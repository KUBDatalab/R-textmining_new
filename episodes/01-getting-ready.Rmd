:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 


- Which packages are needed?
- How is the dataset loaded?
- How is a dataset inspected?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Knowledge of the relevant packages
- Ability to to load the dataset
- Ability to inspect the dataset

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Getting startet
When performing text analysis in R, the built-in functions in R are not sufficient. It is therefore necessary to install som additional packages. In this course we will be using the packages `tidyverse`, `tidytext` and `tm`.

```{r library, include = FALSE, message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(tm)
```


```{r library_show, eval = FALSE,  message = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("tidytext")
install.packages("tm")

library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(tm)
```

* [tm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/tm.pdf)

## Getting data
Begin by downloading the dataset called `articles.csv`. Place the downloaded file in the data/ folder. You can do this directly from R by copying and pasting this in your terminal.

```{r download-data, eval = FALSE}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KUBDatalab/R-textmining_new/main/episodes/data/articles.csv", "data/articles.csv", mode = "wb")
```

After downloading the data you need to load the data in R's memory by using the function `read_csv()`

```{r, eval = TRUE,  message = FALSE, purl = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
articles <- read_csv("data/articles.csv", na = c("NA", "NULL", ""))
```

## Data description
The dataset contains newspaper articles from the Guardian newspaper. The harvested articles were published on the first inauguration day of each of the two presidents. Inclusion criteria were that the articles had to contain the name of the relevant president, the word "inauguration" and a publication date similar to the inauguration date.

The original dataset contained lots of variables considered irrelevant within the parameters of this course. The following variables were kept:

* __id__ - a unique number identifying each article
* __president__ - the president mentioned in the article
* __text__ - the full text from the article
* __web_publication_date__ - the date of publication
* __pillar_name__ - the section in the newspaper

### Taking a quick look at the data
The 'tidyverse'-package has some functions that allow you to inspect the dataset. Below, you can see some of these functions and what they do.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::: solution

### How to show the first / last rows

```{r head}
head(articles)
```
```{r}
tail(articles)
```


:::::::::::::::: 

:::::::::::::::: solution
### How to show information about the columns

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(articles)
```
::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::: solution
### Get the names of the variables / columns
```{r}
names(articles)
```
 
:::::::::::::::: 

:::::::::::::::: solution
### Get the dimension of the dataset (number of rows and coloumns)

```{r}
dim(articles)
```

::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Packages must be installed and loaded
- The dataset needs to be loaded
- The dataset can be inspected by means of different functions
