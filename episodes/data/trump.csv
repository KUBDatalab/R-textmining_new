1,2017-01-20T18:30:08Z,Opinion,"Divisive, ungracious, unrepentant: this was Trump unbound","Inaugural speeches are meant to heal, but he evoked dark historical echoes and confirmed our worst fears","Well, what were you expecting? Did you somehow think that the Donald Trump of the long, bitter campaign of 2016 would be miraculously transformed in the Washington rain, emerging as a kinder, gentler man, ready to serve as healer of the nation and humble steward of the free world? Because if you did, you were sorely disappointed. Of course he didn’t change. The naive thought he might shift a year ago, when he became the Republican frontrunner, or in the summer, when he became that party’s nominee, or in November, when he won the election. And some, finally, clung to the hope that he would “pivot”, undergoing a metamorphosis as he placed his hand on the Bible and took the oath to become America’s 45th president. But they were wrong. The Trump on the steps of the Capitol was the same Trump the world has come to know and fear. As he did at his party convention in Cleveland, he came with a message full of anger and foreboding, slamming the record of his predecessor and depicting a bleak American dystopia. He spoke of “American carnage”, of gangs and drugs, crime and decay. And he was unafraid of the darkest historical echoes. “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first,” he said, “America first” – embracing once again the slogan of the 1930s nativist movement of appeasers and antisemites who sought to keep the US out of the war against Nazism. Elsewhere, in rhetoric that sounded chilling coming from a would-be strongman who allegedly used to keep a volume of Hitler’s speeches at his bedside, he declared, “We are one nation … We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.” For a listening world, there was little of comfort. He announced a new age of protectionism, not hiding from the word. “Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength,” he said, in defiance of the historical experience that says protection leads, in fact, to crisis and world war. There was no mention of Nato or anything that might smack of multilateral cooperation. Instead Trump used his inauguration to usher in a new, Darwinian era in international relations. From now on, “all nations [will] put their own interests first”. That’s how Moscow and Beijing see the world, but it’ll be a shock for those smaller nations who have long looked to the US to maintain something close to a rules-based international system. In other words, Trump did what he always does: he shredded the rule book. Inaugural speeches are meant to be exercises in national unity, binding the wounds of a divided people and sending a message that might hearten the rest of the world. Not for Trump. There was no gracious nod to his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, no hand outstretched to those who didn’t vote for him. Instead, he spoke to his own voters, doubling down on the message of economic nationalism that brought him those narrow margins in the key rust-belt states. He spoke of “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape”, the workers who had been “forgotten” and “left behind”, and promised they would be forgotten no more. For them this speech – and, indeed, slogans such as America first – would have been compelling. They will be readier than ever to believe that he is about to make good on his multiple, impossible promises – including the eradication of “radical Islamic terror” from the face of the Earth – as well his defining and closing pledge: to make America great again. So what should those who have long dreaded this moment do now? For some, the inauguration marks the launch of what they’re already calling “the resistance”, as if they are facing not just an unloved government but a tyranny. Note the banner held aloft by one group of demonstrators that read simply: “Fascist.” Placards and protests will have their place in the next four years. But those who want to stand in Trump’s way will need to do more than simply shake their fists. The work of opposition starts now – and here’s how it might work. At the front of the queue, as it were, are the press. There’s no doubt Trump sees it that way. With Clinton out of the way, the media has become his enemy of choice. The media’s very existence seems to infuriate him. Perhaps because it’s now the only centre of power he doesn’t control. With the White House and Congress in Republican hands, and the casting vote on the supreme court an appointment that’s his to make, it’s no wonder the fourth estate rankles: he already controls the other three. That puts a great burden of responsibility on the press. Trump has majorities in the House and Senate, so often it will fall to reporters to ask the tough questions and hold the president to account. And it won’t be easy, if only because war against Trump is necessarily a war on many fronts. Just keeping up with his egregious conflicts of interests could be a full-time job, to say nothing of his bizarre appointments, filling key jobs with those who are either unqualified or actively hostile to the mission of the departments they now head. It’s a genuine question whether the media has sufficient bandwidth to cope. But one move could help. Journalists might need to break the competitive habits of a lifetime and, every now and then, work as a team. That need was illustrated in last week’s press conference, when Trump turned on, and refused to take a question from, a CNN reporter, branding the network purveyors of “fake news.” Had the other journalists present refused to ask questions of their own until their CNN colleague was allowed his moment, Trump would have had to give way. In a similar vein, reporters should get into the habit of following up their colleagues’ inquiries. It may not force Trump or his spokespersons to answer awkward questions, but at least it’ll make it a tad harder for them to ignore them. But there’s also a question of focus, for the press and for opponents alike. It’ll be tempting to go after Trump for his late-night tweets, for the insults he will surely keep firing off – whether at Meryl Streep or the cast of Hamilton – and for the general boorishness that has made him so repellent to so many millions. Tempting, but if it’s allowed to dominate the way we speak about this president, wrong. Listen to the advice of the Italian scholar Luigi Zingales, who recalls the long battles against Silvio Berlusconi – like Trump, a master player of the media, orange-hued and coated in a Teflon that meant no scandal ever stuck. Berlusconi was in the end defeated only by those who “focused on the issues, not on his character”. Attacking Trump as a douchebag might be cathartic, but it’s unlikely to be effective. Too many Americans knew that about him but voted for him anyway. Better to attack Trump as a president. Which is not to say that there’ll be no room for mockery. Lord knows, laughter will be a crucial weapon against Trump, as it is against all authoritarian strongmen.(Indeed, humour seems alien to Trump: comedy director Judd Apatow this week noted that he had never seen the new president laugh properly.) Alec Baldwin and Saturday Night Live, along with Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee and others are the bearers of a solemn, quasi-constitutional duty: to point a jeering finger at the emperor with no clothes. But that will count for nothing if there is not a popular movement of dissent, one that exists in the real world beyond social media. Some believe the mass rally is about to matter more than ever. Trump, remember, is a man who gets his knowledge of the world from television, and who is obsessed by ratings. How better to convey to him the public mood of disapproval than by forcing him to see huge crowds on TV, comprised of people who reject him? And this will have to be backed by serious, organised activism. The left can learn from the success of the Tea Party movement, which did so much to obstruct Barack Obama. That will force congressional Democrats to consider whether they too should learn from their Republican counterparts, thwarting Trump rather than enabling him. And opponents should keep their eyes on the prize. Yesterday’s most poignant image was of the Obamas leaving the White House for the last time. Eight years ago, that was Bush and Cheney. One day, it will be Donald Trump. That moment will come. The task now is to ensure it comes sooner rather than later."
2,2017-01-20T11:00:05Z,Opinion,14 ways to Trump-proof your life,"Don’t panic: you can take action, and make yourself safer. Here’s an incomplete list of tips and resourcesTrump’s here. We have four years to write a better story We could’ve avoided Trump. Now, we must learn the lessons","If there’s anything that will ensure the next four years aren’t a total disaster – and that Trump serves just one term – it’s collective action. In that vein, this list attempts to set out two things: some basic ways to protect yourself as Trump takes office, and ideas for challenging his agenda, in your own backyard and on the national stage. It’s incomplete, of course. But if you learn just one lesson, let it be this: take precautions, but don’t forget to take action too. Protest against the inauguration Organizers have issued a call for people to converge on inauguration day (J20) to “delegitimize Trump and all he represents”. You could be one of them! For more information, check out disruptj20.org. Can’t make it to the capital? Join a demonstration happening in your city. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people will converge for the Women’s March, unified by a broad set of principles. You could even strike. Take action beyond J20, too Resist Here – an effort backed by the Working Families party – invites anyone anywhere to put pressure on their elected officials to reject Trump’s agenda, complete with resources and step-by-step guides for those new to organizing. Support people working with groups under attack Whether you’re an immigrant yourself or looking to support communities that might come under threat as a result of Trump’s policies, Cosecha might be a good place to start. Just after the election, its organizers put out an open call for people to turn everything from college campuses to churches to cities into sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants. You can pressure the institutions you’re part of to do the same, and may also want to attend a bystander intervention training in your area. Join up If you’re in a union, get more involved in it. If your workplace isn’t organized, organize it! If you’re black, you could join up with Black Lives Matter network chapter near you, or BYP100. If you’re a Latino or Latina, you might get involved with Mijente. If you’re Jewish you could join #IfNotNow. If you’re a Bernie Sanders fan, maybe join the Democratic Socialists of America. Whatever group makes the most sense for you. There’s no point in being angry about Trump on your own. If you have the means, give to the grassroots Because grassroots groups will never be as well funded as Trump’s cabinet picks, donating to any of those listed above wouldn’t hurt either – even if it’s just a few dollars. And the water protecters at Standing Rock could always use funds and supplies. Want some other suggestions? Try MPower Change, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, the Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity, Fight For The Future, Put People First, No More Deaths, the Movement for Black Lives, Southerners on New Ground, the Indigenous Environmental Network and the Grassroots Global Justice Alliance. Get legal help If you are undocumented or have concerns about your legal status, this directory can help you find services available in your state. If you’re able to get pregnant but don’t want to right now, get an IUD In short order, reproductive rights could come under assault. You should consult your healthcare provider to determine which contraceptive method is best for you. One nice thing about IUDs, though, is that they can last for up to 12 years, meaning they will weather Trump’s administration and then some. (While you’re there you can get STI testing or take advantage of the other sliding scale health services Planned Parenthood and other sexual health providers offer.) Bolster your data security The Electronic Freedom Foundation has a great guide here, as do the Intercept and HackBlossom. Here’s one more. Read them over, and do what you need to to keep yourself safe. Support independent media As mainstream outlets become increasingly corporatized, keeping independent publishers afloat will be critical – especially if press freedoms start to come under attack. Donating to public radio and television is always a good call, as is supporting smaller outfits like Democracy Now!, In These Times and Dissent. (And of course, you can become a member of the Guardian for less than $7 a month.) Read up on how resistance has worked in the past The works of Charles Payne and Frances Fox Piven might be good starting points, as is – for a more recent example – the Ferguson Syllabus. Look abroad Autocrats are nothing new on the global stage. Countries all over the world are undergoing their own far-right and anti-democratic resurgences, from Turkey to Brazil to Poland to France, and can offer lessons for those looking to take on Trump. If you can, get a passport too. Just in case. Learn from the Tea Party If you’re mad about Trump, you may not be a fan of the Tea Party. But there are vital lessons to take from the movement. Four former congressional staffers – all of whom were on staff while the Tea Party was dishing out fresh hell to Obama and Congressional Republicans alike – have compiled a no-frills guide on how to apply their strategies to resisting Trump’s agenda. Read it and get started. Get local Our Revolution – the official outgrowth of the Bernie Sanders campaign – is backing a slate of progressive challengers around the country, and may be a helpful guide if you want politicians to support in your own backyard. Better yet, run for office yourself. It’s easier than you might think. And lastly: don’t panic. Rebellions are built on hope"
3,2017-01-20T14:58:45Z,Opinion,The honeymoon is already over for President Trump,Shocking poll numbers tell of a uniquely difficult path for the new commander-in-chief. And that’s before the inevitable scandals startDonald Trump sworn in as 45th president,"Today marks the beginning of the end of Donald Trump’s presidency. It isn’t wishful thinking to begin the countdown to Trump’s self-destruction on his inauguration day. It’s merely a statement of the facts of presidential life: this is no longer a game played out on TV and Twitter. Everything changes when The Apprentice star takes the oath of office on that stage outside the Capitol. Legally, politically and diplomatically, Trump’s world is utterly transformed. What passed before as media outrage now has a measurable impact on his presidential polls and by extension his presidential power. What passed before as a sycophantic discussion with his own attorney now opens the door to endless litigation and the clear and present danger of impeachment. What passed before as a curious cozying up to Vladimir Putin is now transformed into a multi-agency investigation into illegal foreign payments to undermine the election. We should not confuse populism with popularity. Trump enters the Oval Office as the weakest new commander-in-chief in living memory. Having lost the popular vote by almost 3 million, he has no political mandate to speak of. And his disastrous poll numbers are hard to overstate. This is the high-water mark of every president’s approval ratings – before they do the tough stuff of governing and encounter one of the many fast-moving crises that pass through the West Wing. At the height of his popularity, Donald Trump is polling as badly as George W Bush at the end of his doomed presidency, after the catastrophic collapse of the economy and the bloody disaster of the Iraq war. A bumper crop of pre-inauguration polls tell the story of how deeply unpopular the 45th president is already. His personal popularity is as low as 32% compared to 61% favorability for President Obama. Approval of his transition shows him trailing Obama by an even greater margin: just 40% like the way Trump has performed since November, compared to 84% for Obama’s transition eight years ago. Even George W Bush, elected after the extraordinary recount and legal coup in 2000, earned a 61% rating for his transition. These aren’t trivial numbers. They are the white blood cells of the circulatory system that flows through Washington. Good poll numbers can inoculate a president when Congress opposes him. Bad numbers reveal a president vulnerable to outside attacks and embolden his many rivals both inside and outside his own party. Those numbers are about to get a lot worse. In his first year in office, Obama lost more than 15 points on his job approval. If Trump follows the same track, he will be polling in the mid-20s by this time next year. To put that into context, Richard Nixon’s job approval on the day he quit the Oval Office was 24%. And no Mr President, these aren’t rigged polls. The polls just reflect what people think of you, and they all rate you poorly both on a personal and professional basis. Here’s what’s rigged: an election you can win after losing the popular vote by more than 2 points, as the polls correctly forecast. What could drive Trump’s poll numbers so low? Unlike Obama, who inherited the worst economy in two generations, the incoming president cannot blame external forces. The greatest threat, both to his presidency and the republic, comes from Trump himself. Somewhere near the top of the list is potential profiteering from the presidency through his continued ownership of the Trump Organization. It seems Trump will be in breach of the government lease on his new Washington hotel as soon as he is sworn into office today. His efforts to hold onto the lease – which specifically prohibits government officials from holding it – will reveal his true priorities in office. According to his personal attorney, Trump has drawn an ethical line by appointing his own ethics officer inside his own company. This is a quaint arrangement favored by foxes guarding henhouses. The ethics of the Trump Organization are irrelevant; the ethics of the presidency, however, are governed by article one of the constitution, which prohibits gifts of any kind from foreign powers. Even under his own sham scheme, the new president has already breached his so-called ethical standards. “President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated,” Trump’s attorney Sheri Dillon told the press last week. “The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump’s presidency.” This will come as news to the good people of Aberdeen who are about to witness the dramatic expansion of the Trump golf course in Scotland. That expansion, confirmed just this week, involves another 18 holes, a new 450-room hotel, a timeshare complex and a private housing estate. Trump’s staff brush aside these niceties by saying the Scottish deal is just a wafer-thin mint of an expansion of an existing deal. Sadly the constitution doesn’t distinguish between new and existing deals when it strictly prohibits the president from drawing any benefits from foreign powers. It just says they are all unconstitutional. What kind of deals might breach the now famous emoluments clause? As ProPublica has detailed, there’s the Indian deal in Mumbai that involves the vice-president of the ruling BJP party, who is also an elected official. There’s a deal in Bali, Indonesia, with an Indonesian politician, who has partnered with state-owned companies from China and South Korea. And there’s a deal in Manila with a man recently named as an economic envoy to the US by the murderous President Duterte of the Philippines. You don’t have to be a constitutional law professor to appreciate the legal and political jeopardy for Trump. President Clinton was impeached for lying under oath about sex, a supposedly high crime and misdemeanor that is not actually cited by the constitution. Unlike making money from foreign officials, which is. Finally there’s the noose that’s tightening around Trump’s alleged Russian relationships. You know, the ones the new president said IN ALL CAPS absolutely don’t exist and never have, not ever, oh no. The FBI and five other agencies are now investigating whether Russia covertly transferred cash to pay email hackers in the United States as part of a broader Kremlin plot to influence the presidential campaign in Trump’s favor. We also know that counter-intelligence officials are investigating possible contacts and ties between Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Russian officials. Almost every scandal gets compared to Watergate, but very few genuinely deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. Of course, Watergate wasn’t potentially financed by our mortal enemies in Moscow, even if it did involve undermining a presidential election. The last covert plot between a president’s inner circle and an enemy state was Reagan’s illegal gun-running operation to Iran. Perhaps that’s what Trump means by stealing Reagan’s slogan about making America great again. Now that he’s the 45th President of the United States, the rules of this game have officially changed. Donald Trump cannot trash tweet his way out his problems any more. The constitution does not provide for that particular escape pod from Air Force One. The TV star is now the desperately flawed lead in a tragicomedy, the author of his own misfortunes. If our bodies are our gardens, this president has unnaturally orange thumbs."
4,2017-01-20T12:50:18Z,News,Women's movement 'powder keg' ignited by Trump election,"Saturday’s Women’s March on Washington expects up to half a million people, as 1.5m around the world protest in support","Donald Trump’s election has ignited a powder keg under the global women’s rights movement that will have far-reaching ramifications, according to organisers of a global women’s march due to take place on Saturday. As many as 500,000 people are expected to descend on the US capital for the Women’s March on Washington the day after Trump’s inauguration, joined by as many as 1.5m more marching in support in 161 cities across all seven continents. With marches being held in 61 countries from Germany to East Timor, organisers from Women’s March Global, the international arm of the Washington march, are determined to capitalise on the wave of activism that has attracted hundreds of thousands of first-time campaigners as well as seasoned activists. “The women of the world were sitting on a powder keg and Donald Trump just lit the match,” said Evvie Harmon, a Women’s March co-founder and global coordinator. Set up after Trump’s election victory, the global movement is being hailed as an unprecedented grassroots movement and organisers say it will have an immediate and concrete impact. Many international coordinators say they are marching in solidarity with US women, but that human rights and not Donald Trump are the focus. Cells set up throughout the US and hundreds of other places are plotting local campaigns, from preventing the construction of oil pipelines to outlawing female genital mutilation. They will be based around the “guiding vision” of the Women’s March on issues such as the rights of immigrant, disabled and LGBTQIA women and female workers. Individual groups will decide which targeted actions to take, Harmon said. “I don’t know any grassroots organisation that has grown to this size in only two months. There are now about 1,000 coordinators around the world. It’s too big and it’s growing too fast to control,” she said. “And we wouldn’t want to. We just want to support and help it to flourish.” Marches are due to take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Erbil, Iraq where an organiser from Alliance for Peace and Human Rights (APHRO) said holding the march was a challenge because of tribalism, corruption and the difficulty of getting approval from the government “who deny that women have challenges in this Iraqi society”. “With solidarity we women are daring to stand up to the challenge of lack of salaries, terror, hate, exploitation, and trafficking,” she said. In the UK 25,000 people are expected to join the Women’s March on London, with another 14 marches in towns and cities across Britain including Cardiff, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Leeds and Belfast. On Friday the campaign group Bridges not Walls unfurled banners with anti-Trump messages across bridges in British cities, and protesters on Tower Bridge in London held up pink letters reading “Act now!” Thousands of people were expected to gather outside the US embassy in the early evening for a rally organised by the Stand Up To Racism campaign. As many as 500 marchers could turn up in the small town of Shipley in West Yorkshire, in the constituency of the Conservative MP and vocal Trump supporter Philip Davies. “If we don’t raise our views, it’s like people with the Trump and Philip Davies view of the world have won … there is a good half of the population who don’t want that kind of world, and we have to speak up,” said Sue Easterbrook, one of the organisers. The global Women’s March, which also includes a Penguins for Peace protest on an expedition ship in Antarctica and a small gathering in East Timor, marked a dramatic renewal of feminist politics, said Sophie Walker, the leader of the UK’s Women’s Equality party. “People are realising that the time to act is now, they don’t have to wait for permission to tell the world what they want and believe in,” she said. Populist rhetoric had created a sense of urgency and desire for action, said Amnesty’s UK director, Kate Allen. “Human rights and women’s rights are hard won and at this critical time it is vital to stand together to celebrate our gains and against discrimination and division,” she said. “The politics of fear have no place in 2017.” Karen Olson, a global coordinator of the Women’s March based in Geneva, said the movement had “mind-boggling potential”. Technology such as the messaging service Slack, which enables global campaigners to connect in real time, and the reach of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter was “incredibly powerful”, she said: “We are building a global movement, not focused on a negative catalyst but on everything we hold dear.” Harmon, a yoga teacher before joining the movement as a coordinator, said she and many others were not prepared to stand down after Saturday’s protests. “If this doesn’t continue to grow it would be an awful waste of what we have accomplished,” she said. “I am going to be marching until we achieve equality. I’ll stop then, or when I die.” Why I’m marching Maria Kostaki author, 43, Athens While not a citizen of the US, I am organising this march in Athens because I believe the issues it represents are global. It’s about humanity. It’s about women’s rights, racism, equality, LGBT rights. I have a four-year-old son and I do not want him to grow up in a world where everything we have fought for is taken away. We can’t allow anyone to reverse what we have built. Lotje Horvers tour manager, 34, Amsterdam I want to be part of the message to the world that there are more people who love than people who hate, and I will not stand by silently while a lying bully is given one of the most responsible positions in the world. I cannot be at peace with the fact he uses his voice to set an example that it is acceptable to be demeaning to women and minorities. Rachel Druck rabbinical student, 31, Tel Aviv I am studying to be a rabbi and one of the major values of Judaism is accepting the other, making a place for the stranger and remembering once a year that once we were slaves in Egypt. Those values are propelling me. I’m marching because Trump ran a campaign of Islamophobia, antisemitism, misogyny, and racism: to stand up and say he does not speak for me. Natalino Soares Ornai Guterres consultant, 27, Dili, East Timor I have been displaced from my home and have travelled to other countries (including the US) in search of better opportunities. Being a member of the LGBT community, I am involved because I understand the struggle that our mothers, sisters and people with non-binary gender identities have to go through in a patriarchal society. Aisha Ali-Khan part-time teacher and carer, 36, Shipley I wanted to show solidarity with the rest of the women all over the world. Women are not being heard by those in power anywhere in the world – if they were we wouldn’t be marching today. I’m a Muslim, of Pakistani heritage – this is not just a white women’s march, it’s all women, all over the world. It’s a really inclusive movement and it’s amazing to be a part of that. Shoomi Chowdhury Amnesty International, London We have so much left to do with regards to rights for ethnic minorities, particularly women from ethnic minorities, and not only is the potential for progress going to be lost, we’ve taken a massive step back. In 20 years, I want to be able to tell my children “I went out and marched the day after Donald Trump became president”. Nazila Kivi feminist magazine editor, Copenhagen I’m marching in solidarity with people gendered as women all around the world, especially indigenous, queer and migrant women, who are under a double burden of oppression. Women and our bodies very often become battle grounds for conservative and backwards ideas of nations, borders and racist ideologies. Solidarity and activism is all we have. Ritah Mutheu Muia entrepreneur, 37, Nairobi We march as the Her Voice society in Kenya because we stand in solidarity with our sisters from the US. We want to send a message that any act or policies that violate human rights or women’s rights will not be tolerated. In Kenya the fight against gender-based violence is far from over. As Kenyan women we have decided to break the silence."
5,2017-01-20T01:06:54Z,News,"China urges Trump: be our friend, not our enemy",Beijing and state media strike a conciliatory tone amid fears the new president could set the countries on a collision course,"China has urged Donald Trump to be its friend not its enemy, amid fears the tycoon’s inauguration could set the world’s two largest economies on a calamitous collision course. Since his shock election last November Trump has repeatedly put Beijing’s nose out of joint, challenging it over the militarisation of the South China Sea, alleged currency manipulation and North Korea and threatening to up-end relations by offering greater political recognition to Taiwan. The billionaire has also handed jobs to several stridently anti-China voices including one academic who has described its rulers as a cabal of despicable, parasitic, brutal, brass-knuckled, crass, callous, amoral, ruthless totalitarians. But on the eve of Trump’s swearing in, China’s government and state-run media struck a conciliatory tone with the man about to become the United States’ 45th president. “Both sides should try to be friends and partners, rather than opponents or enemies,” Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, told reporters. The Global Times, a Communist party-run tabloid, toned down its usually pugnacious rhetoric, telling readers it hoped the most “singular” president in US history would build a “better world” and “show a sense of responsibility that matches his power”. “The Trump team should project an aura of humility,” the newspaper advised in an editorial. “The US system advocates an assertive political style, but inner modesty is essential.” A leaked propaganda directive suggested China’s tightly controlled domestic media had been banned from publishing “unauthorised criticism of Trump’s words or actions” – likely an attempt to avoid further inflaming tensions ahead of Friday’s inauguration. However, the English-language China Daily took a parting shot at the president-elect, dismissing his team’s “war-like rhetoric” on trade relations with Beijing. “All the trade war threat to China is just the bluffing of a paper tiger,” it said. Scholars on both sides of the Pacific say they are alarmed at the potential for US-China relations to break down if Trump continues to raise Beijing’s hackles over sensitive issues such as Taiwan. “I guess you could say I’m despondent,” said Andrew Nathan, a Columbia University expert in Chinese politics and foreign policy. “I’m feeling very bad; not knowing where it is headed or if it makes any sense or [if Trump is] just following emotions wherever they lead … It makes me very worried about the China relationship.” Susan Shirk, a China specialist who served as deputy assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton, said she feared Trump had already anointed Beijing as the US’ “number two enemy” after Islamic State. “I don’t think we ought to prettify the US-China relationship in its current state. It’s got some real problems… But there are other ways of solving these problems than the kind of radical approach that Trump seems to be pursuing,” said Shirk, now head of the 21st century China centre at the University of California, San Diego. “It’s really a mistake to completely give up on any form of cooperation with China and to see China as already an enemy,” she added. “I don’t think he understands how much clout China now has economically and how much damage China could do to our interests and to those of our friends and allies if we provoke it unnecessarily.” Chinese experts also issued grim forecasts for US-China relations under Trump. “Conflict is inevitable,” Jia Qingguo, a Peking University international relations expert, told the Global Times. “If a trade war breaks out between China and the US, it will also be catastrophic for the US,” warned Wang Jianmin, a Taiwan expert from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. For all those fears there are still some who hope the deal-making president could still manage to strike up a mutually beneficial friendship with Beijing. “Nothing he has done suggests that will happen,” said Orville Schell, the director of the Centre on US-China relations at New York’s Asia Society. “And yet it is completely possible because he is such a contradictory person.”"
6,2017-01-20T18:46:59Z,Opinion,"Guys, there is one Donald Trump, there is one speech",Hopes that a new Trump might step up to the inauguration podium were quickly crushed under the fist of ‘America first’,"As a man mesmerised by his own television persona, Donald Trump couldn’t stop himself staring directly down the lens of the camera poised to capture him just before he emerged on to the steps of the Capitol to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. “Hello,” breathed the star of Mr Smith Goes to Watchimself. Thus begins reality TV’s stunningly unsettling reboot of the fish-out-of-water genre. The president’s inaugural address sounded like it had been assembled from Donald Trump magnetic fridge poetry. Bridges, tunnels, “a historic movement the likes of which the world has never known”. It was as out-of-focus as his hair and served as an ominous reminder that that there is little so dangerous in politics as people who regard incredibly complex things as simple. “We are issuing a new decree: from this day forward, it’s going to be ONLY America first, America first … America will start winning again – winning like never before! … This American carnage stops right here, and stops RIGHT NOW!” Twenty minutes of that, and Barack Obama’s airborne departure had shades of the last helicopter out of Saigon. Washington had fallen, the new president very much wanted America to know, as he stood right in the heart of it and denounced its every effort. As he assured the crowds, strikingly diminished in comparison with Obama’s: “Now arrives the hour of action.” It arrives for the media, too, especially the ones who marked time in the buildup by asking: “Will we see a new Donald Trump out there today?” Guys, there is one Donald Trump, there is one speech. There is no fault with your set. President Trump’s demeanour was so openly populist and bullish that it seemed primarily designed to provide portentous establishing footage for future documentaries with titles like Dark Star Rising, or The Gathering Storm. So unboundaried has the president been in his years-long campaign to lower the tone that it was difficult for any of the speeches, prayers and readings given by anyone else not to sound like a veiled lecture to him. “Pray for wisdom.” “God blesses those who are humble.” May he grant you the ability to resist 4am tweetstorms. Some of the requests were so dementedly hopeful they could only have been included as a dare. “We ask that you give him the meekness of Christ.” But at this point we’d settle for the meekness of Kanye West. It was a day to be glad of the displacement rituals of protocol, especially if you were the Obamas. You come up the stairs. We shake hands. You stand there. Now we wave. I think you take the farther car door. You see – you just made it through five minutes without giving in to the impulse to mention my birth certificate or the unprecedented size of your hands. Only three years, 364 days, 23 hours and 55 minutes to go. A clearly inspired Trump manfully got through the swearing-in oath, even though he must have regarded the whole hand-on-the-Bible aspect as a conspiracy to focus global attention on his little paws. In the event, it was far more dignified than Mike Pence’s oath, which was punctuated by someone in the crowd screaming “LOCK HER UP!” And so to Hillary Clinton, forced to participate in the world’s longest loser’s reaction shot. At the Oscars, you only have to grit your teeth and grin for a minute when Liz Hurley’s name comes out of the envelope instead of yours. On inauguration day, you have to keep that going for hours. The camera trained on Clinton as she waited inside the Capitol, ready to be formally introduced to the crowds by the announcer, caught her taking in a huge breath and setting her jaw. Comic interludes? Trump failing to understand his chair-based dad dancing was bad at the Lincoln memorial rock concert on Thursday night, but more excruciating still when swaying and nodding along to the Mormon Tabernacle choir. Then there was the detail that portable toilets for the crowds were provided by the same local firm which traditionally does it, only this time organisers were so antsy that they covered up the company name on the doors: Don’s Johns. Pretty sure that’s not the urination association they have to worry about. There were also oddly touching moments – like George W Bush being unable to keep the pleasure off his face when Michelle Obama picked him out and turned the full warmth of her spotlight greeting on him. Certainly, it was the first time I’ve seen that smirk look endearing. And it was hard not to feel sympathy for Melania Trump, who still looks like she’s wearing a first lady costume, and radiated anxiety about not putting a foot wrong. In the end, for those on board the Trump train, the aggressive display marked the day the slogan could start becoming a reality. But for much of the watching world, it will seem as if the lamps are going out all over America. It’s unclear when we shall see them lit again."
7,2017-01-20T19:57:34Z,News,A morning with 'adorable deplorables': why Trump supporters are optimistic,"On a bus bound for the inauguration in Washington, backers of the new president explain their views: ‘He isn’t putting people down’Full report: Donald Trump sworn in as presidentWomen’s movement ‘powder keg’ ignited by Trump election","On the bus, in the morning darkness, Steph and Brandi put on their makeup, using a phone as a mirror. Stephanie Friess and Brandi Tillman have been friends since high school, and now they were on their way from Wilmington, Delaware, to Washington to celebrate the man who had given them a brand new country. On election night, Steph stayed up past 3am to see Trump’s victory being announced. The next morning, remembering the night before while driving her car, the 24-year-old felt jubilant to be living in Trump’s America. The two women made matching Trump caps – blue and black – decorated with sequins and the slogan “Adorable Deplorable” in honor of the inauguration. Hillary Clinton had tried to attack Trump for lifting up the most “deplorable” among his followers: “the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic – you name it”. Trump’s followers had proudly reclaimed the term, and now Brandi and Steph bedazzled it. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of women will be marching in Washington in protest of Trump’s presidency in a demonstration called the Women’s March. While large majorities of black and Latina women voted against Trump and for Hillary Clinton, white women didn’t. Brandi and Steph are part of the majority: early exit polls showed that 53% of white women voted for Trump, including 45% of women with college degrees. The two women, both college students, were not entirely convinced by Donald Trump at first. But, Steph said, “he definitely grows on you”. Both friends say they appreciate Trump’s bluntness, his toughness, his lack of greed, and what seems like a genuine love for America. “He wants everyone to be successful,” Stephanie said. “He isn’t putting people down.” Brandi liked Mitt Romney, but “he wasn’t strong enough”, the 25-year-old said. “He wasn’t empowering us enough. He plays that innocent politician role that all politicians play. Trump doesn’t do that.” ‘A cake can’t be racist’ On the bus to Washington, many of the women’s fellow white Trump supporters expressed frustration at constantly being labeled racist. It was a term, some argued, that liberals just threw around whenever they were losing an argument. A local bakery in Pennsylvania had just produced tiny hat-shaped “Make America Great Again” cakes in honor of the inauguration, and a short post about the themed cakes on Facebook had sparked a long debate, with some commenters labelling the bakery racist, or saying they would not longer patronize it. “Why not a “grab ’em by the p*ssy” cake?” one commenter asked. Or a “deport all immigrants cake”? The bus supporters were indignant. They had won. It was supposed to be a day to celebrate. And yet the news was full of protests and threatened disruption, and even a bakery making an inauguration dessert had somehow become divisive. “A cake can’t be racist,” Dave DeFries, a longtime Trump supporter from Delaware County, Pennsylvania, said in exasperation. In the seat behind Brandi and Steph, Laura Ann, 34, who asked that her last name not be used, had bought two of them. She sliced them and handed them out. The cake was moist, the frosting tasting faintly of marshmallow. Laura Ann had voted for Obama twice. She worked in healthcare, and had wanted the president to fix the health insurance system. He had failed. She was still kicking herself for voting for him. As a gun owner with several AR-15 rifles – she found them light and easy to handle as a female shooter – she had also been frustrated by the constant attacks on “the so-called ‘assault rifle’”. “I’d really like to see [Trump] help the inner cities more,” she said. She thought Ben Carson, who grew up in Detroit and went on to become a surgeon, would be a great force in helping urban America. Eileen, at 46, had cast her first ballot ever for Trump. “I want the jobs to come back to America,” she said. Her brother, a systems analyst, had lost his job to workers in India and had been forced to personally train the Indian worker who was taking his place, under threat of losing his pension. Eileen also felt Obama had failed to bring insurance companies in line to bring healthcare costs down. Worried that her high school friends who voted for Clinton would attack her, she asked not to publish her last name. Many of the supporters said they had never been politically involved before Trump ran for president. Several had voted for Obama at least once. Some of the new activists said they were amazed by the energy of Trump’s movement. “It doesn’t seem like a political environment,” Dave Ennis said. “It seems like we’re going to a football game.” Some said that their friends or family were worried that something might happen on inauguration day, that the protests might make DC dangerous. One man mentioned that he had seen a video produced by the conservative provocateur James O’Keefe about activists discussing a plan to throw acid on Trump supporters. ‘It’s like, I get it, I get it, slavery was bad. I didn’t do it’ At the back of the bus, another Dave (who did not give his last name) sat opposite his wife and 16 year-old son, Brian, who he called a liberal “snowflake”. The two of them argued constantly, the father said, especially about Black Lives Matter. Brian said he believed that the Black Lives Matter protesters and the Boston Tea Party rebels were identical – except for their race. Protesters had to be loud to make themselves noticed. His father was more skeptical that black Americans were being unfairly victimized. His own interactions with the police when he was younger had taught him that when people chose a certain lifestyle, the police would target them – and there was nothing wrong with that. Brandi and Steph said that felt that racism toward black Americans had been given a disproportionate platform compared with other kinds of racism. They disapproved of Obama supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, which they saw as racist. “Why is it Black Lives Matter, not all lives?” Stephanie asked. “I just don’t think most cops are out to get black people,” Brandi replied. “The media blows a lot of this out of proportion,” Stephanie said. “I didn’t think it’s bad that we had a first black president. That’s not bad. That’s great,” Brandi opined. But Obama “should not have been elected to a second term. I think his color had a lot to do with that.” In school, Brandi said, some black girls had bullied her, and when she complained, “my teacher told me to grow a thicker skin”. Asked about the systemic inequality black Americans face – in the criminal justice system, or in education – Brandi said that, because she’s been living in Delaware, a relatively liberal state, “maybe I haven’t seen that as much”. “I, like, see the opposite. Black people get free college, ” she said. “My mom’s a single mom. I’m not white privileged, and I’m sick of being told I am.” Both said that felt they had grown up and gone to school while constantly being told things “trying to make us feel bad for being white”. Slavery was a topic of discussion again and again, the schools focused on black authors, “it’s always black history month”. “It’s like, I get it, I get it, slavery was bad. I didn’t do it,” Brandi said. Brandi said she felt bad for her other minority friends – Hispanic, Asian, Indian – who also faced racism, but seemed to get less attention. Her Indian American friends faced job discrimination, she believed, by people who might not think they fit the look they wanted, or who bought into the stereotype that they might be terrorists. ‘I’m a little bit worried about the tweeting’ Both friends also had some concerns about Trump. Stephanie didn’t believe for a long time that Trump could really pull off a presidential demeanor. That’s why she thought Clinton would win. Brandi said she did not believe new environmental protections should be rolled back, and her stepmother had serious concerns about Trump’s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist and school choice advocate whose understanding of basic educational concepts and laws came under question during her confirmation hearing. “I know teachers aren’t very happy about that,” she said. “I’m a little bit worried about the tweeting,” Brandi added. She was concerned, she said, that “he might say something …” “That he can’t take back,” Steph broke in. But for the most part, the two friends were optimistic that Trump would tackle the economy, create jobs, address cyber-attacks, and make America stronger. Brandi, who was waitressing as she went through college, said: “I’d like to see more money. I’d like to see more tips.” Neither of the friends had been concerned about his comments about grabbing women by the pussy. “That was 10 years ago, and people change,” Brandi said. Brandi said if a famous billionaire had tried to grope her, she would have sued immediately, not stayed silent for years until the man ran for president. “Damn straight, if someone gropes me, I would want to sue,” she said. Steph disagreed. She probably would have stayed quiet, she said. A Belgian journalist who was also on the bus then took his turn and interviewed the two women about their support for Trump, and asked them to comment on the fears many Americans have about the coming months. Brandi said her faith as a Christian kept her from being too anxious, and that Americans should calm down. Trump, after all, was just the president. “He’s not God. He’s not Hitler. It’s not the end of the world,” she said."
8,2017-01-20T11:30:52Z,News,"Digested week: more tales of Brexit, Trump ... and Uri Geller","In a week when Theresa May buried the single market, an old book is dug up that seemingly predicted the rise of Trump","Monday I spent Saturday night talking about Brexit to a packed – since you didn’t ask – audience at the Ropetackle arts centre in Shoreham. Apart from being a very enjoyable occasion, it confirmed what many others have been saying: that old party allegiances are breaking down. Where people used to politically identify as Conservative or Labour – or in some cases Liberal Democrat or Ukip – they now primarily identify themselves as leave or remain. If this turns out to be more than a passing trend, it will make for an interesting general election in 2020. Most commentators have focused their attention on the Labour heartlands in the north that voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU and would be vulnerable to a strong Brexit Conservative or Ukip candidate. But there are also some Tories in the south who may have cause to be worried, not least Tim Loughton, the MP for East Worthing and Shoreham. Though Loughton had an easy win in 2015 with a 15,000 majority, things could get a lot tighter next time as his constituency voted 53%-47% to leave. When I mentioned Loughton’s role as cheerleader-in-chief for Andrea Leadsom to be next party leader, his name got boos worthy of a pantomime villain. Tuesday In 1988 Margaret Thatcher chose Lancaster House as the venue to praise the EU single market; it was no coincidence that Theresa May used the same setting to bury it. We hacks were cooped up somewhere in the basement for the best part of 90 minutes before the prime minister gave her speech. Not, it turned out, for reasons of security but to try to keep us from asking any awkward questions of the 27 EU ambassadors who sat stoney-faced throughout the 45 minutes May had their undivided attention. More interesting was Labour’s response. While Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, congratulated the prime minister on not taking the hard Brexit option, Jeremy Corbyn was berating her for turning the UK into a bargain basement tax haven. No wonder the rest of the Labour party weren’t quite sure what they were supposed to say or ask. “We weren’t given any briefing papers,” one MP told me. “When I asked why, I was informed that Labour hadn’t been given enough time to respond.” As most of May’s speech had been pre-briefed to the media several days previously, Labour politicians must have been the only people kept out of the loop. Wednesday When I was 10 years old back in 1966, my parents had a German boy to stay for the weekend as part of a school trip to our town. Before he arrived, my mum took me to one side and said: “When you’re playing war games with him, make sure you say ‘Let’s kill the enemy’ and not ‘Let’s kill Jerry’.” As much of my world view was informed by reading The Victor, War Picture Library comics, and watching films such as The Great Escape, this was probably good advice. At any rate, I managed to get through the weekend without causing a major diplomatic incident. Which is more than can be said for Boris Johnson, who used his visit to India as a backdrop for comparing François Hollande to a Nazi prison camp guard. While his remarks have been excused as lighthearted banter by the likes of Michael “With Friends Like These” Gove, it might be more helpful for the country if we didn’t have a foreign secretary whose understanding of 20th-century history wasn’t still equal to that of a 10-year-old boy in the 1960s. Thursday Much as I instinctively believed Uri Geller must be a charlatan when he turned up in Britain during the 1970s, part of me still wanted him to be genuine. And now it turns out that he just might have been. Recently released files have revealed that the CIA repeatedly tested Geller at the Stanford Research Institute between 1972 and 1976 and the Israeli spoon-bender kept passing with flying colours. Time and again, when locked in a sealed room and asked to draw the same image as a scientist was drawing elsewhere in the building, he came up with an uncannily similar picture. According to Geller, the CIA was so convinced of his paranormal powers it roped him in to telepathically order a top Russian official to sign the nuclear arms reduction treaty. But one thing still bothers me. If Geller is so brilliant, why did he waste so much time bending spoons and stopping watches? If I was that gifted, I’d have much more fun. Friday “The senator [later President Windrip] was vulgar, almost illiterate, a public liar easily detected, and in his ‘ideas’ almost idiotic, while his celebrated piety was that of a travelling salesman for church furniture, and his yet more celebrated humour the sly cynicism of a country store. Aside from his dramatic glory, Buzz Windrip was a Professional Common Man. Oh, he was common enough. He had every prejudice and aspiration of every American Common Man. He believed in the desirability and therefore the sanctity of thick buckwheat cakes with adulterated maple syrup, and the superiority of anyone who possessed a million dollars. He regarded spats, walking sticks, caviar, titles, tea-drinking, poetry not daily syndicated in newspapers and all foreigners, possibly excepting the British, as degenerate.” Not a modern commentary on Donald Trump, but an extract from the 1935 novel It Can’t Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis which has just been republished by Penguin.

9,2017-01-20T04:56:34Z,News,US intelligence investigating Russian links of leading Trump associates – report,"President-elect’s team denies any knowledge of inquiries, which according to the New York Times involve ex-campaign chief Paul ManafortDonald Trump swon in as 45th president – live coverage Will the new president halt investigations about himself?","Donald Trump’s transition team has been forced to distance itself from reports that American intelligence agencies have intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russia and associates of the president-elect. On the eve of Trump’s inauguration as the 45th president of the United States, the business dealings of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort were among the matters under investigation, the New York Times reported, citing current and former senior American officials. Manafort, who stood down as Trump’s campaign chief in August 2016, has made millions from consulting work while working for pro-Russia oligarchs including Rinat Akhmetov, Dmitry Firtash and Oleg Deripaska. The National Security Agency has conducted surveillance of Manafort’s business contacts, the Times said, for suspected links to Russia’s security service, the FSB. Other Trump associates whose contacts are said to be under the microscope include Carter Page, an investment banker who worked in Russia and who was a foreign policy adviser to the campaign, and Roger Stone, whose involvement in Republican politics goes back to Richard Nixon. However, the Trump team denied any knowledge of the investigations – which have reportedly been led by the FBI and supported by the NSA, CIA and the treasury department’s financial crimes unit – or why they might be under way. “We have absolutely no knowledge of any investigation or even a basis for such an investigation,” said Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump transition. Manafort called the allegations that he had interactions with the Russian government a “Democrat party dirty trick and completely false”. “I have never had any relationship with the Russian government or any Russian officials. I was never in contact with anyone, or directed anyone to be in contact with anyone,” he said in an emailed statement. “On the ‘Russian hacking of the D.N.C.,’” he said, “my only knowledge of it is what I have read in the papers.” The reports follow weeks of intrigue over the possible involvement of Russia in trying to help Trump win last November’s election. A secret CIA analysis reportedly concluded that people with connections to the Russian government provided emails, hacked from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign, to WikiLeaks in the runup to the 8 November election. In December, outgoing president Barack Obama ordered US intelligence to review evidence of Russian interference in the election, although the Times reported that it was not clear whether the latest revelations were part of that review."
10,2017-01-20T04:19:48Z,News,DeploraBall: Trump lovers and haters clash at Washington DC event,Hundreds of demonstrators gather to wave placards and shout slogans at the National Press Club where pro-Trump event held•Donald Trump inauguration: the world holds its breath – live coverage •Inauguration day schedule: our guide to the day,"Chaos erupted outside the DeploraBall on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration as protesters clashed with supporters of the president-elect. “Nazi scum!” a masked man yelled through a police barricade at a woman in a sequined gown as she defiantly waved her ticket for the event. A woman held a sign that read “Look, Ma. It’s a racist misogynist” with an arrow pointed toward the guest line. In response a man flipped open his suit jacket to show her his shirt, which read: “Deplorable lives matter.” Hundreds of protesters filled the street in front of the National Press Club, the chosen venue for the DeploraBall, a name inspired by a remark made by Hillary Clinton, who referred to some of Trump’s supporters as a “basket of deplorables”. Law enforcement blocked off the street to cars for the protest on Thursday night. Two rows of police in riot gear guarded the entrance to the club and much of the sidewalk. A number of the ball’s attendees were thought to be associated with the “alt-right”, a far-right movement in the US that has praised the Republican president-elect. The event has also revealed friction within the movement, as the DeploraBall’s organizers distanced themselves from the extreme elements of the group. The movement has come under intense scrutiny following a conference in December 2016 when Richard Spencer, the white supremacist who coined the term “alt-right”, declared: “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” and some in the audience gave Nazi-style salutes. The event attracted 1,000 of the president-elect’s most fervent supporters in an evening dedicated to celebrating “Trumpism” in the city he railed against. The dress code, according to the event’s website was “black tie optional – aka ‘fun formal’ – aka no rules”. From behind the police line, protesters flashed middle fingers and shouted obscenities and insults, calling the guests “fascists” and “racists”. “The red hats are better than white sheets,” one man said. “Watch your pussies, ladies,” a woman shouted at female attendees. The taunts occasionally turned to the police. “Who are you protecting?” the crowd chanted after the police cleared the sidewalk. An inflatable white elephant emblazoned with a banner that said “racism” loomed over the crowd. Protesters in hoods and masks set fire to a pile of placards in the middle of the street. Another group beamed floodlights at the top of the building to project the message: “Impeach the Predatory President.” Clashes broke out between Trump supporters, protesters and the police. At each sign of unrest a crush of reporters and onlookers rushed to the scene as officers barked at them to move back. In one skirmish a man was carried to the sidewalk by police after being struck in the head with an object lobbed by a protester. The impact was hard enough that the man began to bleed. After the incident, police closed the sidewalk in front of the press club. “I don’t think most of these people know what they’re talking about,” said Daniel, a Trump supporter, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of being harassed online. “It’s pretty ironic that they call themselves the party of anti-violence and free speech.” Sarah Coles arrived at the protest wearing an rainbow colored “H” pin. She had come from the White House, where she and a group of friends had “poured one out” for Barack Obama and his vice-president, Joe Biden. Coles said she was heartened by the show of resistance to Trump. But she never doubted that America could elect a president who antagonised racial and ethnic minorities. “My family is from Alabama. They lived there in the late 30s and 40s. We’ve seen these kind of things happening,” said Coles, who is black. “But my mother told me: ‘The Republic will survive this.’ And I have to believe her.”"
11,2017-01-20T18:19:12Z,News,Donald Trump sworn in as 45th president of the United States,"Trump describes ‘American carnage’ in dark inauguration speech in which he vows to transfer power from political elites ‘back to you, the people’Follow our live coverage of inauguration day","President Donald Trump has set out a bleak portrayal of a nation under siege, vowing to end “American carnage” in an inaugural address that fired up his supporters but did little to ease the fears of American liberals or an anxious world. Moments after being sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, Trump described a country in crisis and pledged an isolationist and protectionist cure, declaring: “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first.” Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton looked stone-faced during the speech, while George W Bush at times appeared uncomfortable. But there were cheers from Trump’s supporters on a rainy National Mall in Washington. The crowd was largely white and notably smaller than for many past inaugurations. Under the dome of the US Capitol, the billionaire businessman hailed the “historic movement” that swept him to a shock victory over Hillary Clinton in last November’s presidential election, claiming it was unique in world history. Citizens expect great education, safe neighbourhoods and good jobs, the 70-year-old continued. “But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealised potential. “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.” It was a grim account of the most prosperous nation on earth from a man denounced by critics as an authoritarian populist. Trump’s aides had indicated that one of his inspirations for the speech was John F Kennedy’s inaugural address in 1961. But there were closer echoes of a 1968 speech by Richard Nixon that described “cities enveloped in smoke and flame” and hearing “millions of Americans cry out in anguish”. As America’s political elite looked on, Trump went on to blame past US governments for favouring other nations at the American people’s own expense, from the military to infrastructure to factories. “We’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own,” he said. “But that is the past. And now, we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first, America first.” For some, the phrase “America first” has disquieting associations with a 1940s movement that aimed to keep America out of the second world war and came to be accused of antisemitism. But on Friday the crowd, many wearing “make America great again” baseball caps and other regalia, applauded and cheered. Trump continued: “Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. “Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.” Breaking with Republican orthodoxy, Trump promised a massive infrastructure building programme including roads, bridges, airports and tunnels, potentially creating thousands of jobs and costing billions of dollars. “We will follow two simple rules; buy American and hire American.” Trump’s longshot candidacy has proved uniquely divisive ever since he launched it in June 2015 by denouncing Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. He also proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and earned the support of white nationalists. His speech is unlikely to have assuaged the concerns of progressive activists who intend to march in protest on Saturday. “At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other,” Trump said. “When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. “The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity. We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.” Trump had said in advance he hoped to emulate Ronald Reagan’s 1981 inaugural address. And there were clear echoes in his blunt 16-minute address of Reagan’s creed that government is not the solution but rather the problem. “Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people,” Trump said. “For too long, a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed. “The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. “That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment, it belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country. “What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.” Trump lost no time in sitting down at the US Capitol to sign a waiver for his defence secretary nominee, James Mattis, as well as documents for his other cabinet nominations and a proclamation for a national day of patriotism. There was some light banter with leading Democrats over pens. The physical transfer of power was mirrored online. A “top issues” section of the White House website moved priorities of the Obama administration – including civil rights, climate change and the Iran nuclear deal – to an archival website and replaced them with headings such as “America first energy plan”, “America first foreign policy,” “Bringing back jobs and growth” and “Making our military strong again”.

12,2017-01-20T00:26:44Z,News,"On eve of inauguration, Trump addresses nation in shadow of Lincoln","Trump spoke at the Lincoln Memorial, where Martin Luther King Jr declared ‘I have a dream’, and told the largely white crowd: ‘You’re not forgotten any more’Donald Trump inauguration: the world holds its breath – live coverage","Donald Trump staked his claim to Washington on Thursday by promising to “make America great again” while at the feet of the US capital’s giant marble statue of Abraham Lincoln in a celebration of patriotic music, military pageantry and fireworks. The president-elect delivered a brief speech from the Lincoln Memorial, close to the spot where in 1963 Martin Luther King Jr declared, “I have a dream.” Trump told the largely white crowd: “You’re not forgotten any more.” On a cold night of heavy and sometimes heavy-handed symbolism ahead of Friday’s inauguration, Trump led thousands of supporters in chants of “make America great again”, saying: “And I’ll add, greater than ever before.” A spectacular array of fireworks shot into the sky and spelled: “U-S-A” as the Battle Hymn of the Republic rang out. Accompanied by his wife, Melania, and other family members, he then walked up the steps and spent the better part of a minute silently contemplating the seated Lincoln, the president who won the civil war and helped end slavery. His celebrated Gettysburg address and second inaugural address are inscribed on the chamber walls. Supporters lined the pool at the National Mall, many wearing “Make America great again” baseball caps and other regalia, though the area was far from full and some left early as temperatures plummeted after dark. Nearby were the Vietnam war memorial and ghostly figures of soldiers at the Korean war memorial. But it was the juxtaposition with Trump’s fellow Republican Lincoln, the 16th and arguably greatest US president, that was most striking. Hollywood actor Jon Voight, a vocal Trump supporter, told the crowd: “President Lincoln who sits here with us I’m sure is smiling knowing we will be led by an honest and good man, who will work for all the people no matter their creed or colour. We will see a renewed America.” Some observers, however, found the choice of the Lincoln Memorial jarring. Keith Stiggers, 25, who is African American, said: “When I saw that I was like, wow! Probably a lot of his supporters don’t like Lincoln and his legacy for the country. Is he going to uphold that legacy or is he going to do what he can to step on it?” Stiggers, a law student, had come with his fiancee to support democracy and feels that Friday’s inaugural address will be crucial. “I think he should definitely build bridges. He got a lot of support from the ‘alt-right’ and now he should make it clear he is governing for all Americans. His speech is going to be very important; it’s going to dictate the pace of his presidency.” The free “welcome celebration” had begun just after 4pm with military marching, music and pageantry, including the national anthem, followed by a change of gear with drummer DJ Ravidrums (Ravi Jakhotia), who has served as a personal DJ for Hugh Hefner. Behind him giant TV screens flashed the names of every US state. There were performances from soul singer Sam Moore and an improvised country music group, laden with patriotism. Eventually Trump and his wife, Melania, appeared to the soundtrack of the Rolling Stones’ Heart of Stone. The president-elect turned to give Lincoln a military salute before descending the steps to chants of “Trump! Trump! Trump!” They joined other family members behind protective glass to watch artists including the Piano Guys – “It’s time to put all our differences aside” – rock band 3 Doors Down, Lee Greenwood and country singer Toby Keith, who was introduced as “one of the most popular artists in history”. Trump is said to have had trouble attracting A-list stars to appear at the event. Tom Barrack, president of the presidential inauguration committee, then introduced the TV celebrity and businessman turned politician. “I would like you to pay tribute to the courage, to the strength, to the loyalty of this man,” he said. Trump, holding a microphone in his left hand, thanked his supporters and said: “I’m just the messenger … It’s a movement like we’ve never seen anywhere in the world, they say … it’s something that’s very, very special. The phrase, you all know it, half of you are wearing the hat: make America great again.” Trump reflected on the noisy rallies of his election effort, which few observers thought would lead to Friday’s ceremonies 18 months ago. “There was never an empty seat, like tonight,” he said. “We all knew that last month of the campaign … we knew that something special was happening. “The polls started going up, up, up, but they didn’t want to give us credit. Because they forgot about a lot of us. When the campaign started I called it the forgotten man and forgotten woman. Well, you’re not forgotten any more.” The crowd cheered. Trump promised to bring jobs back, and not let other countries take US jobs any longer, while also rebuilding the military. “We are going to do things that haven’t been done in our country for many, many decades, I promise you.” Washington is a Democratic stronghold where Trump polled less than 5% in the election, but his supporters relished their time in the capital. Chris Lehman, 55, a maintenance supervisor from Belmar, New Jersey, said: “It’s thrilling to be here today. This is a historic event. We’ve got a president again who’s proud of the country and will bring jobs back to the country. It’s a good feeling. He’s brought jobs back even before he’s taken the keys to the office yet. Unfortunately he’ll probably spend the first 20 days undoing the garbage President Obama did at the end to slow him down.” Lehman, 55, booked his hotel in nearby Baltimore before the election because he was so confident of Trump’s victory. “You don’t become a billionaire by losing and not knowing what you’re doing,” he said. “He speaks his heart and he speaks his mind. You know what he’s saying is the truth, and you’ve got to love a president like that. He doesn’t owe anybody anything. He can come in and do this right.” Shannon Wilburn, 48, who runs a Christian youth centre, travelled with a friend from Roby, Texas, for her first visit to the US capital. “We just wanted to be here as patriotic Americans. It’s a bucket list thing to see a swearing-in of a president. I do believe Donald Trump is a Christian. One of the biggest things is his pro-life stance and, as a Christ follower, it’s very hard to accept someone who’s not.” Wilburn said she doubted that Trump will be able to bridge the partisan divide in his inaugural address on Friday. “They’re not even going to give him a day. Look at the Democrats boycotting it. He can’t get one day of grace. That’s a little frustrating, I think.” Nearly a million people are expected on the National Mall in Washington for a ceremonial transfer of power that will observe time-honoured traditions and pageantry but usher in profound political uncertainties. Trump has promised to shake up the postwar liberal order, issued contradictory policy statements and, even before taking office, sparked anger in foreign capitals with his volatile approach. Questions have been raised over the character and temperament of a man who boasted about groping women and still picks fights on Twitter. Protests are expected on Friday, and a huge women’s march is planned for Saturday, as liberals dig in for four years of opposition to Trump, who enters office as the most unpopular of at least the past seven presidents at the beginning of their terms, according to opinion polls. He also takes power under the shadow of Russia’s alleged meddling in the presidential election, which has led some Democrats to question his legitimacy. Up to 60 members of Congress will boycott the inauguration ceremony at the US Capitol. At least 28,000 security personnel from 36 state, local and federal agencies will be deployed for inauguration events, reportedly costing $200m, divided between taxpayers and private donors. Parts of the capital are on lockdown, with steel barriers erected on normally busy streets, to head off disruptive protests. Trump and his wife, Melania, will on Friday morning go to the White House for tea with Obama and his wife, Michelle, even as house movers work upstairs to swap their private possessions. The inauguration ceremony will begin with performances by the Talladega Marching Tornadoes, the Rockettes dance troupe, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and 16-year-old singer Jackie Evancho. At noon, in a scene not so long ago unthinkable to the political establishment, Trump will take the oath of office, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. He will place his hand on his own Bible – a gift from his mother in 1955 – as well as a Bible used by Abraham Lincoln at his first inauguration. In an operatic tableau, standing nearby will be Hillary Clinton, the candidate Trump threatened to jail during the campaign. She received 2.9 million more votes than he did last November but lost the electoral college. Former presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Jimmy Carter will also be present. Trump will become the first US president in the 240-year-old republic who has never served in the military or held public office. At 70 he will also be the oldest in his first term, eclipsing Ronald Reagan’s record. Barrack said Trump’s inaugural speech would focus on “the issues that unite us” and claimed that the divisions from the campaign would “vanish”. “What you’ll hear in his address is a switch from candidate to president,” he told the CBS This Morning show."
13,2017-01-20T11:24:44Z,News,"Red, white and who? Trump inaugural concert features few A-listers",The free show managed to wrangle Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down along with several second-tier acts performing for ‘not particularly diverse’ fans •Donald Trump inauguration: the world holds its breath – live coverage •Inauguration day schedule: our guide to the day,"Stalwart patriotism, showy entertainment and flagrant nostalgia ruled the day at the “Make American Great Again! Welcome Celebration” inaugural concert in Washington on Thursday. The show, presented in front of the Lincoln Memorial a day before Donald Trump’s official swearing in as president, earned uncommon advance coverage for an embarrassing reason. So many major stars turned down the offer to perform at the event, it seemed like any critically respected, or commercially significant, artists would sooner be struck deaf than participate. One star who initially signed on – singer Jennifer Holliday – felt pressured by her fans to back out days before. The two-hour free show managed to wrangle several star acts – including Toby Keith – though they were mainly ones who appeal to listeners who live far outside the country’s largest cities, and whose music ranks low on the approval scale of the nation’s tastemakers. In that sense, the performers aptly mirrored the sensibility Trump so deeply tapped into. CBS correspondent Chris Van Cleef described the audience in the ticketed seats for the event as “not particularly diverse”. The free show began with the US army band pumping out traditional instrumental marching music, followed by The Star-Spangled Banner. More historic music came from The United Old Guard Fife and Drum Corp, who performed a medley of songs from the 18th and 19th centuries while decked out in period military pomp. The first pop performer to take part – DJ Ravidrums (Ravi Jakhotia) – stressed the athletic side of percussion rather than the soul or groove of it. The Vegas-friendly star, who has served as a personal DJ for Hugh Hefner, bashed a drum set sprawling enough to entirely entrap him while multiple screens flashed the names of every US state. A brief segment in his opening set interpolated America the Beautiful as if it were being performed at a rave. The classic soul singer Sam Moore, of Sam &amp; Dave, echoed Jakhotia’s song choice. He performed the anthem in a gospel-soul arrangement, recalling Ray Charles’s famous take on the song. Moore, best known for boomer touchstones such as Hold On, I’m Coming, sang the song gamely, first with a lone piano accompaniment, then with a fine gospel choir backing him. A cobbled-together group (The Frontmen of Country) also appeared, sifting together members of three second-tier Nashville acts – Little Texas, Restless Heart and Lonestar. They offered a medley of songs saluting great American places – three of them set in Texas, all of them honoring the south. The songs included The Bluest Skies of Texas, God Bless Texas and Walking In Memphis, a cover of the old Marc Cohn hit. The Frontmen’s set melded into a performance by 74-year-old Lee Greenwood of his touchstone God Bless the USA, which brought the crowd to its feet. The song implicitly presents patriotism as something disfavored and in need of defense against unmentioned foes. 3 Doors Down, the sole rock act to appear, qualifies for that genre to the same flimsy degree that Nickelback does. The band’s opening song called for people to “stand up and take back your world today” – a clear rebuke to the Obama administration. The Piano Guys struck a more conciliatory note, announcing at one point: “It’s time to put all our differences aside. When we do, it’s going to be OK.” Like Trump, the foursome rose to power outside the usual system, initially using YouTube as their path to success rather than the major labels. The act lived up to its reputation for squeaky-clean family entertainment, offering an instrumental take on One Direction’s bubblegum hit What Makes You Beautiful. For a flash of showmanship, three of the four members plucked the inner strings on the grand piano, making it seem less like a musical performance than a team sport. The show’s headliner – Toby Keith – struck a balance between outreach and outrage. At the end of his first number, American Soldier, a sincere salute to America’s veterans, he thanked the outgoing president, Barack Obama, for “his service”. But his four-song set culminated in a hit that represents the most bellicose brand of patriotism possible. Courtesy of the Red, White &amp; Blue (The Angry American) presents America as an engine of vengeance, with lyrics like: “You’ll be sorry that you messed with/the U S of A/Cause we’ll put a boot in your ass/It’s the American way!” During one long lag between the performers, the sound system pumped out recordings by The Rolling Stones, including (bizarrely) Let’s Spend The Night Together and You Can’t Always Get What You Want (which Trump had used during his campaign stops). Early in the event, one speech broke up the musical entertainment. Actor Jon Voight presented Trump as a victim of a “grueling year” fueled by a “barrage of propaganda” and all the “negative lies” fired his way. At an event meant to unite, statements like those could barely have leaned harder into America’s wide divides."

In his inaugural address on Friday, the new US president said his arrival in office had “special meaning” because “we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people”. As many were quick to point out on Twitter, that line had an uncanny echo of one spoken by Bane, the masked villain played by Tom Hardy in Christopher Nolan’s 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises. “We take Gotham from the corrupt! The rich! The oppressors of generations who have kept you down with myths of opportunity, and we give it back to you … the people,” Bane declares in the movie. Bane is the villain in The Dark Knight Rises, while the hero is a billionaire scofflaw with access to unthinkable destructive technology who favors brutally assaulting criminals."
15,2017-01-20T11:19:54Z,News,George Soros: Theresa May won't last and Trump is 'would-be dictator',Billionaire investor delivers bleak Brexit forecast at World Economic Forum and says Donald Trump is ‘gearing up for trade war’ but will fail•Donald Trump inauguration live: the world holds its breath•Inauguration day schedule: our guide to the day,"Theresa May will not remain in power long as Brexit cripples her government, while Donald Trump is a “would-be dictator” who is “going to fail”, the billionaire investor George Soros has told the Davos world economic forum. On the eve of Trump’s inauguration as president, Soros delivered a scathing assessment, saying the “impostor and con-man” was “gearing up for a trade war” which would have “a very far-reaching effect in Europe and other parts of the world”. The “would-be-dictator … didn’t expect to win, he was surprised”, Soros told an audience of business leaders and journalists in Davos where the World Economic Forum is being held. “I personally have confidence that he’s going to fail … because his ideas that guide him are inherently self-contradictory,” added Soros, who was a supporter of Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Soros said he expected financial markets to “not do very well” because of the uncertainty generated by the Trump administration. On Theresa May and Brexit, Soros predicted economic upheaval in Britain and substantial difficulties in bringing about a clean break with the European Union – and the prospect of the UK quickly joining again or entering a successor arrangement once the referendum mandate of leaving the EU was fulfilled. “In my opinion it is unlikely that prime minister May is actually going to remain in power. Already she has a very divided cabinet, a very small majority in parliament. And I think she will not last,” he said. “At the moment the people in the UK are in denial. The current economic situation is not as bad as was predicted and they live in hope. But as the currency depreciates, and inflation will be the driving force, this will lead to declining living standards. “This is going to take some time, but when it does happen they’ll realise that they are earning less than before because wages won’t rise as fast as the cost of living. “The divorce is going to take a very long time. It’s much harder to divorce than to get married, so I think the desire for rapprochement will develop, and in theory or maybe even in practice you could have a situation in 2019 or 2020 when Britain will leave the EU, because it does have to take place, but they could leave on a Friday but join over the weekend and have the new arrangement in place in Monday morning.” Soros said he hoped both sides would realise they must find some common ground and find common ground to avoid a bitter divorce. The future for Europe looked bleak, Soros said, after a disastrous 2016. Europe had become too complicated, leaving people alienated and anti-European parties gathering force. May, speaking earlier at the forum, said Britain had voted with “determination and quiet resolve” to leave the EU but it was “overwhelmingly” in Britain’s interests for Europe to succeed. “Britain must face up to a period of momentous change. It means we must go through a tough negotiation and forge a new role for ourselves in the world. It means accepting that the road ahead will be uncertain at times, but believing that it leads towards a brighter future for our country’s children, and grandchildren too. “We are going to be a confident country that is in control of its destiny once again.” With the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse"
16,2017-01-20T08:45:20Z,Opinion,‘It was sunshine and pantsuits. Then Trump won.’ Writers on their protests,Our panel describe what they’re doing to protest against the inauguration; from the UK Women’s March to talking about sexual assault in Washington,"Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett: I’m marching to be with others who believe in equality, justice and human rights I will be marching in London on Saturday because I still can’t quite believe this is happening. The horror that I felt when Donald Trump was elected has not subsided. I still cannot believe that a man who has shown such contempt for women, disabled people and people of colour could become the most powerful person in the world. I’m marching because my brother, the man whom I helped to raise and the person on this planet whom I love the most, is severely autistic. When I was at school, kids on the bus used to imitate the noises and the gestures that he made. Now the sort of school bully that I thought I had left behind will be president of the US. And just as I fought them, I will fight this. I’m marching because I don’t want to be alone when that happens. I feel a profound need to be with other people, particularly other women, who believe in equality, justice and human rights. And because the thought of dumbly watching without making my displeasure felt is too depressing for words. I want to stand in solidarity with women in America whose reproductive rights will undoubtedly come under attack. I want them to know that we are out there, thinking of them, and fighting for them. I’m marching because a man who is much, much more stupid than Hillary Clinton and millions of other women, has been granted the power he has, partly because of his gender and despite his designs on women’s rights. And I want the daughter I hope one day to have to know that I was not OK with that. That I am not OK with the continued abuse, harassment, violence and discrimination suffered by women. That I am not OK with this man’s indifference to climate change, and his views on race and incompetence. That I am not OK with the fact that the elite are already gradually normalising him. This situation is far from normal. It is distressing, and embarrassing, and terrifying, and I can’t just do nothing. That’s why I’m marching. Micah White: I’m preparing for the day after the march when we need to get serious about building a social movement I’ve been an activist all my life, but I am not joining the mass marches against Trump this weekend. This is why. Right now the biggest challenge facing American activism is not the size of our protests or the volume of our dissent. Instead, what is holding us back from winning is that even if, by some stroke of divine luck, our protests were to topple Trump, we have no movement capable of taking power and governing after his fall. Our leaderless social movements remain incapable of making complex decisions together. We can raise awareness but we are still unable to win elections. American activism is lagging behind our comrades in Europe who have built powerful electoral movements such as Spain’s Podemos, Italy’s Five Star Movement and Iceland’s Pirate party. Until protesters in America are backed by a credible movement that can win elections and govern effectively, our street protests will remain a performative temper tantrum, at best. How to win elections and govern is the essential challenge that every genuine activist must now turn to solving. In the weeks and months ahead, I’ll continue the revolutionary experiments that I’ve begun in my tiny town in rural Oregon. I’m confident that if the collective creativity of American activism is oriented toward replicating the successes of electoral movements abroad then we can pull it off bigger than anyone else. So when people ask me if I’m joining the Women’s March in my community this weekend, or if I’ll be flying to DC to be raucous with my movement buddies during the inauguration, I tell them the truth: I’m staying here and preparing for the day after the march, when the protesters return home and are ready to get serious about building a social movement that uses protest to sweep the midterm elections in 2018. I’ll be waiting for you. Mary Jane Wells: An inauguration ball gives me a platform to highlight sexual consent I am a British-born actress and writer whose recent work revolves around sexual trauma. Tonight, I’m going to a ball celebrating the inauguration of a man who is the focus of at least 24 allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour. What the hell am I doing? I was invited to the Vetty’s Presidential Inaugural Ball after working on a film called Holy Hell, about a sociopathic narcissist cult leader. So when I received an invite and the opportunity to speak for a few minutes in front of a crowd of US military top brass and – potentially – President Trump, I was torn. I live in a Californian echo chamber, where everything was sunshine, grapes and pantsuitable possibility. And then Trump won. I decided, despite my violent opposition to all he stands for, to attend the ball. I am not a celebrity, my boycott would mean nothing, and personal politics are inconsequential when there is an opportunity for a conversation about sexual consent, vulnerability and addiction to power with the leader of the free world – and especially this one. This is about leadership. We need more women in positions of military command, and access to an independent justice system for military sexual trauma (MST) survivors. We need women in the army to no longer be blamed with the old boys’ club adage of “You know what happens when you put boys and girls together …”. With a weak commander-in-chief, the values that sustain a prepared, cohesive military force also weaken, while sexual assault, bullying and mobbing systematically increase. During my moment on stage, I will stress the need for an independent inquiry into all incidences of MST. The US army is the most powerful in the world, and potentially an incredible force for peace. How is that peace ever achievable with an inward-looking system that potentially demands reporting to your own assailant? But such peace is a pipe dream unless it is brokered first between soldiers on the same side. I hope the crowd will listen. Nona Hurkmans: Our banners tell vulnerable people they are not alone What’s the point of protesting against an American president in the UK? What use is it? The point is visibility. And the use is showing our support to people who feel nervous about this presidency. This Friday, Bridges Not Walls – a collaboration between different organisations and individuals – is dropping banners with positive messages on more than 100 bridges (or mostly bridges) across the UK and around the world. Messages such as “Build bridges not walls”, “Still we rise” and “Queer solidarity smashes borders”. The aim is as simple as the action: to let vulnerable communities and individuals know that we stand with them. And there are a lot of these communities: women, Muslims, migrants, people of colour, disabled people, LGBTQ people, anyone whom Donald Trump has mocked, insulted, threatened to exclude or shown a complete lack of respect for. The list is long. The message we’re trying to put out is that we’re here, we’re with you, we’ll stand up for your rights, and we’re not going anywhere. And this message is not just for Americans. This isn’t just about Trump. In Britain, we’ve seen plenty of the language Trump has used, and it’s had an impact. Recorded hate crimes in the UK were up 41% in the month after the Brexit vote compared with the same month the year before. And who’s surprised, with the kind of billboards Nigel Farage sees fit to put up – a giant materialisation of a Trump tweet complete with visuals. “Breaking point” indeed. Even Theresa May couldn’t do better than to say she’s looking forward to working with the man who once suggested a female political opponent was too ugly to be elected. With our banner drops on Friday, Bridges Not Walls hopes to signal to vulnerable people that this should not be the new normal. You are not alone. You can speak up. Because what happens next is up to us."
17,2017-01-20T06:00:01Z,Opinion,"We could’ve avoided President Donald Trump. Now, we must learn the lessons",There were hundreds of opportunities to stop the Republican demagogue. That should focus our minds as he takes the oath of office•Donald Trump inauguration: the world holds its breath – live coverage•Inauguration day schedule: our guide to the day,"The road to President Trump was long and bumpy. There were many turns not taken, countless alternative routes that would have spared us this outcome. Instead, we kept going, corruption, infighting and sheer obliviousness stopping us changing course. What could have been different? There are a thousand possibilities. You could start with the long decay of the US news media into a branch of the entertainment industry, primed to seize on Trump’s celebrity. A wiser society would have demanded better, resisted more vocally, criticised more intelligently. Or the rise of Silicon Valley, its hypercapitalist, libertarian ethos helping to weaken traditional sources of information. We now suffer pandemic attention deficit disorder, fake news, hackable everything, cyberwar, and social media bullies, of whom Trump is bully-in-chief. An internet run as a public commons rather than an ad-driven free-for-all would have had very different social consequences. We missed that turning long ago. Or the erosion of civil rights. People of colour have been systematically disenfranchised by a series of interventions, including the gutting of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. Millions were effectively cut out of the election. Their full participation would have made Trump impossible. A renewed voting-rights movement will be part of how we crawl out of the hole we find ourselves in. That will have to include better voting systems and national voting-rights standards. The abolition of the electoral college also is long overdue; its peculiar mechanisms eked out a meagre victory for the loser of the popular vote. And we must undo the gerrymandering that so dramatically favours the Republicans. Or you could backtrack about 90 exits: imagine we had taken the dangers of climate change so seriously that, I don’t know, we had a completely different election about completely different issues, or the several such elections our environmental crisis actually merits. The road is perhaps too pretty a metaphor – call it a highway to hell and start looking for the off-ramps. We’ve missed enough already. This year, you’d be forgiven for thinking “left” was short for “left behind”. Many progressives got stuck in the primary stage, fighting Hillary Clinton as though she were running against Bernie Sanders, rather than Trump, all the way to November. Those who should have known better seemed unable to imagine that anything could be worse than neoliberalism. The Democrats bear responsibility for years of compromise and muddle; they floundered ineffectually while their rivals strategised with brilliance. They can do better – some of them have and will. The leadership shown this month by John Lewis and Barbara Lee, inauguration refuseniks, has been heroic, and the election of the Senate’s first Latina and second African-American woman were high points in an election that plumbed the depths. But more powerful Democrats could have worked harder to stop Trump, starting with the outgoing president of the United States. Barack Obama had all the intelligence information that was belatedly shared with us. He even used the so-called nuclear phone to call Vladimir Putin in October and tell him to stop intervening in the election. He had power over the FBI, and might have installed senior staff who were more loyal to the country than the Republican party. As it was, the FBI smeared Clinton and protected Trump. The latter’s triumph was made possible at least in part by our current president’s dedication to positioning himself above the fray, projecting Olympian calm. This was a season during which he should have been asking himself what Lyndon Baines Johnson would have done, back when the Democrats were fierce fighters. I turned off the radio after Obama said, in his final speech: “In 10 days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy, the peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected president to the next.” I yearned for a leader who would say something like: “Hey, there was foreign intervention in this election, along with voter disenfranchisement, so maybe it wasn’t free and fair. If there was collusion on Trump’s part, that’s treason, so we’re putting it all on hold and asking the supreme court what they think about all these unprecedented problems.” Obama’s statesmanly grace was, in fact, needless acquiescence. Other politicians, as well as ordinary citizens, tried to get the juggernaut to stop. Even Republican senators – John McCain and Lindsey Graham – demanded an investigation of the Russian business before the election, and several of the Democrats on the Senate intelligence committee asked Obama to release the classified information he was withholding. It turns out that a lot of people had material which they could have used to make a fuss before the election on 8 November, or before the electoral college met on 19 December, or before the joint session of Congress certified the result on 6 January. That day, seven Democratic congresspeople stood up to object, but no senator would stand with them. Later, Senator Dianne Feinstein said she believed that Russian intervention and James Comey’s sabotage changed the outcome of the election (and polls pretty much confirm that Comey delivered the coup de grâce). We didn’t need to know the minutiae of the Russian intervention; we already knew that it raised questions so grave that the whole transfer of power should have been halted while it was investigated. As it is, we now have an incoming president whose greatest commitment seems to be to Russian interests, including undermining the EU and Nato, and full-steam-ahead pursuit of fossil fuels. Now we’ve reached the inauguration, in an Oldsmobile with four flat tyres and a boiling radiator, some of us are looking ahead, to where the U-turn options are. That civil society has been galvanised is good news, though it’s hard to anticipate what the fights will look like: basic rights are at risk and pretty much the most destructive candidates imaginable for every cabinet position, from education to the environment, are likely to be confirmed. We need electoral reform to re-enfranchise people of colour and the poor. We need the wild-eyed young radicals to take over the Democratic party and make it reflect their hopes and dreams. We need smart strategists to make the most of the very promising rifts in the Republican party. We need to tell our stories better and learn to influence what stories get told. We need an endless series of reforms, from media and technology to education and healthcare. There’s more than enough work for everyone. There will be too much, and each of us will have to find a piece of the problem where we can be effective and stick to it. We’re going to have to build alliances – that means working alongside people with whom you agree about the big things and not quibbling about the little ones. We’re going to have to remember what kind of power civil society has and how to use it. We’re going to have to be brilliantly organised. Millions were asleep at the wheel; the shock has jolted us awake. What lies ahead is unmapped – but at least we are finally paying attention."
18,2017-01-20T16:35:54Z,Opinion,"Women will march against Trump. We may lose, but it’s still worth it","We’ve been told that the Women’s March is pointless, confused, counterproductive. All the more reason to make sure we are seen and heard","Women, know your limits. Thou shalt not halt the rhetoric of misogyny legitimised by the rise of Donald Trump by taking to the streets on your silly Women’s March. No, stay indoors! Just soak up this wave of misogyny because everything is lost and protests never ever work and face facts: one of the problems with this Women’s March (though everyone is welcome) is that it contains way too many women. That’s bound to alienate certain guys … I have seen such views propagated on social media. Basically, women such as me organising, resisting, coming together just for a few hours in many cities around the world to make themselves visible is somehow not the right sort of opposition to Trump. We have been patronisingly told that the Women’s March will make things even worse. For whom, one has to ask? We have also been told that now is not the time. I agree: we should have done this long, long ago. We could have read the runes; feminism has been demonised by the right as responsible for everything from unemployment to domestic violence for some time. Such a narrative is now mainstream, and we see to what and where it leads. This march, though, initially arose out of the fear and frustration of a grandmother in Hawaii. Her Facebook group led to the setting up of the march in Washington. Sister marches were soon announced in many cities across the globe. People, some of them women, clearly felt the need to organise, to mark what is happening and to make our voices heard. That is fairly simple. For some of us it is about showing international solidarity. But I don’t pretend protest is ever simple. There are always tensions. It is both an anti-Trump protest and a rally for women’s rights. These two things are intimately connected: Trump is part of a backlash against feminism that has been a long time brewing. Trump has no subtext. His hatred of women is overt. Women are property or ornament. This is not hidden; his appointments include those who want to roll back reproductive rights for the women who need them the most. His promise is about unabashed white power. His victory is a victory for overt racism as well as overt sexism. I wonder if those telling women not to march would tell people of colour not to protest? The criticism that the goals of the march are too vague has some validity, though actually the organisers in Washington have thrashed out a series of goals that try to take into account the complicated meshings of race and gender. This is not easy. Nor new. There will be those in the march in London who are uncomfortable with some of the others on it. There are groups supporting this march whose politics are very far from mine, but I will have to get over myself. So will everyone else. I have seen women complain that the march is too feminist or not feminist enough. Others have said that it’s pointless as we won’t bring down Trump. D’oh! Those who stir themselves, mainly on social media, to protest against the protest may think they are being iconoclastic but they are merely expressing their powerlessness. If voting doesn’t work and protest is useless, what exactly is the answer? Surely it lies in the relationship between the two, and that involves ongoing organisation. Any activist worth their salt knows that’s what the real work is. But protest is also a way to bring on the next generation, to connect, to mourn and then to find some optimism about where we are at right now. Out of fuzzy goals and all the different views there will be a pulling into focus. Sure, I remember the anti-apartheid marches with their clear and obvious objectives, but I also remember Greenham Common and the miners’ strike, which we lost. In both victory and loss however, understanding the power of defiance and collectivity is something to experience. Yes, that is old-fashioned, that feeling of solidarity, of walking beside others. The unfurling of banners and daft placards, the aching feet and children in pushchairs, the forging of bonds and the actual fun of protest. Some people will be there to make themselves feel better as well as make the world a better place. That’s how it works. One of today’s goals is surely to energise and connect women, to say to those who feel under attack: we are here too. You go on ahead. We have got your back. All of us have seen the disconnection of many from any kind of politics and also the disconnection between social movements such as Occupy from electoral politics. The prize is now to connect. Those who would take away women’s rights have already mobilised their anger and frustration and many have been slow to realise it. We now have to do the same thing. We will be seen and heard."
19,2017-01-20T05:00:00Z,Opinion,The President Trump effect may be a whole new British focus on Europe,"His views have little support here or on the mainland. But then, he is a uniquely American phenomenon, and most politics is local","A cold January week has brought the west a chill new-year reality check. First Theresa May confirmed that Britain really is closing the door on the European Union not lingering by its fireside. Now, the stage is set in Washington for the words “I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear …” to usher America over the threshold and into the unknown. Later this year similar thresholds may be crossed in other lands. A Dutch general election in March in which the nationalist anti-immigrant Freedom party (PVV) may outscore all rivals and double its representation. A French presidential election in April and May, which the Front National’s Marine Le Pen may even win. A German election in the autumn where the anti-immigrant AfD, one of whose regional leaders condemned Berlin’s holocaust memorial in a speech in a beer hall this week, is expected to make gains. When future historians look back at these times they will not search for long before they discover that many in the west believe they are facing a general crisis, not an aggregate of local problems. The current level of UK media interest in French politics, for instance, is without recent precedent. It will doubtless have another spurt when the French socialist choose their presidential candidate this weekend and next. But the reason it is occurring is that observers sense there may be some connection between events in the UK and the US and the coming contest in France. In normal times, the British mind is shamelessly insular about European politics. Until recently, the only country that interested us was America, which we think is like Britain even though it isn’t. But that’s all changed. It’s an irony, as Jeremy Corbyn might say, that it has taken leaving the EU to make us more interested in Europe. But it’s true. That’s because all these events — Brexit, Trump, the coming contests in Europe, and not forgetting Scottish and Catalan separatism either — appear to be shaped by common origins from which no country seems immune. Globalisation, migration, inequality, stagnation, social media and disillusion know no borders. Opinion in the west seems launched on an age of rage. Historians — or at least people who studied history when I did — are familiar with the theory of a general crisis. One such theory was about 17th-century Europe. Events like the thirty years’ war in what is now Germany, the civil wars in Britain and the Fronde in France all seemed to speak of a social and economic crisis with shared roots, in which inflation and religious disputes were specially important. Historians like Eric Hobsbawm and Hugh Trevor-Roper differed about the extent to which the 17th-century crisis was economic or political, but not about whether it was an important question. In the end, though, the argument about any general crisis can only take one so far. In the 21st century, just like in the 17th, there are common factors that cross boundaries and there are echoes from one situation to another. Yet the differences also matter enormously. Why was there a revolution in 1640s England but not in 1640s France, when many of the same arguments and stresses were common to both? Because England and France sing their histories in different keys, that’s why. The same caution about borderless generalisations is needed today. This is true in spite of the fact that we clearly live in a period where democracies in many countries are failing to deliver sufficient fairness in the face of global economic and technological change. But they are doing so in their own distinctive national ways, too. The use of the term “populism” to explain this has become so loose that it actually explains less and less. It should perhaps be pensioned off. The Brexit vote is an important example of why this is so. The referendum was not called because of controversies about immigration, political elites or factory closures. David Cameron conceded it because he faced an obsessive generational concern on the Tory right, in the rightwing press and in some pretty prosperous parts of England, about UK sovereignty. The referendum was called for the reason that it said on the tin — the wish to leave the EU. When it finally came, of course, other issues such as migration and dislike of Westminster attached themselves with great force and opportunism to the leave campaign. That’s why May said what she said this week. Yet even so there was a very distinctively British and English complexion to the leave victory that has few real equivalents anywhere else. It’s simply not true, for instance, that Euroscepticism is carrying all before it in European politics at the moment, as Brexiters and parts of the UK press sometimes like to pretend. If that were so, Italy would never have survived the collapse of Matteo Renzi’s government following December’s referendum, Le Pen would be racing ahead in the French polls, Geert Wilders would eclipse all comers in Holland, while the rightwing Norbert Hofer would have swept to victory in the Austrian presidential contest last month. In reality, none of these things have happened yet. Renzi’s successor Paolo Gentiloni’s main problem is his own health — he has just had a heart operation —not the immediate survival of his government. Both Le Pen and Wilders are polling strongly, but no more strongly than a few months ago. Le Pen, indeed, is in some danger of slipping into third place behind the centre-left’s Emmanuel Macron in the race to the Elysée. In some ways it looks as if Europe’s democracies are managing to absorb these angers in their different ways, not succumbing to them like a row of dominoes. None of this is to predict that Beppe Grillo’s Five Star movement has peaked, or that Le Pen and Wilders won’t shake up their respective countries when the elections come. But it is to warn against the tendency to extrapolate from one country in the facile way of too many. Yes, politics is changing and yes there are parallels. But, no, this is not a general crisis. That’s still partly the way to look at Trump, too. Trump is a thoroughly American phenomenon. His only remote recent peer in Europe was Silvio Berlusconi, who can only be understood within Italian conditions and because Italy is a much more rightwing country than many like to pretend. No European leader of importance, not even May, truly embraces Trump’s ideas. Yet Trump matters. He matters because America matters. Since 1945 the US has been, as the FT’s Philip Stephens wrote yesterday, “Europe’s pre-eminent power”. Yet on every issue of international importance, from trade to Russia to climate change to international law, Trump’s views are at odds with those of European nations and peoples, Britain included. It is another irony that it may ultimately take Trump to make Britain take Europe more seriously. It is also another reminder that most crises, like most politics, are local."
20,2017-01-20T18:03:08Z,News,"In pledging to put 'America first', Trump holds the world at his mercy","The new president lamented aiding other countries at the supposed expense of the US, in inaugural speech that emphasised counter-terrorism‘American carnage’: Trump’s vision casts shadow over day of pageantryClinton stands stoic as former rival derides ‘all talk no action’ politics","In his inaugural address, Donald Trump did not just promise to change his own country, he pledged to “determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come”. The 45th US president put the rest of the planet on notice on Friday that it would, from now on, have to deal with a United States that is far less willing to do things for other countries, buy their products or protect their borders. Trump pledged to “reinforce old alliances” but at the same time made it clear his administration would be less willing than its predecessors to underwrite the west’s collective security. While transition officials have been assuring US allies that American support would be undiminished despite the new president’s repeatedly voiced scepticism about Nato’s purpose and insistence that the country’s friends should pay more for their defence or risk forfeiting US protection, in his short speech in the rain on Friday Trump made it clear that the “America first” approach would be central to his foreign and security policy, in place of the multilateralism that was the hallmark of the Obama White House. “We’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own; and spent trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay,” he said. “But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it’s going to be America first.” It is far from clear yet what “America first” will mean in practice, but Trump’s campaign slogans suggest that a Trump administration would build up US nuclear and conventional forces significantly, but would be less prepared to use them to shore up other countries’ defences, or help bolster shaky governments and societies overseas. “We’ve made other countries rich, while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon,” Trump said, reinforcing his previous insistence that Washington would no longer get entangled in “nation-building”, and deepening expectations that US overseas aid budgets could face drastic cuts. The new president has recently described Nato as “obsolete”, but there was no suggestion in his speech that his administration would leave the pact. Trump did suggest, however, that he would look for other alliances more exclusively focused on counter-terrorism. “We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth,” Trump said. The pledge of eradication is one that no US ally will take seriously. The fight against terrorism is expected to take decades, if not generations. Meanwhile, the mention of new alliances will raise questions about whether the new president will seek to rebalance the country’s foreign relations and seek new partners. No single foreign country was mentioned in the speech, but Russia’s presence loomed after Friday’s inauguration. Trump’s associates are reported to be under investigation in a multi-agency inquiry into their contacts with Moscow over the course of the campaign, and the new president was consistent throughout the campaign and the transition period in praising Vladimir Putin and defending him from criticism for Russian actions in Ukraine and Syria."
21,2017-01-20T15:28:16Z,Opinion,The Peace Ball: black brilliance and resistance on the eve of the Trump era,"At the Peace Ball on the night before the inauguration, a stellar line-up of African American thinkers held out hope of unity in the face of fear","The night before Donald Trump was set to become the 45th US president, I had a sense of dread akin to what I feel the night before an operation. On its eve, this inauguration felt like an unpleasant surgery to be gotten through the next day – except, rather than feeling like it would heal the patient, I worried this bloody procedure would kill the national body on the operating table. I passed this anxious period at the Peace Ball, a gathering of beautiful minds and activists which celebrated recent wins for justice and entertained possibilities for a better future. It was held at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture (which should really be known by its better nickname, the “Blacksonian”). Before the apocalypse, being surrounded by Black art and listening to the wisdom of scholar Angela Davis, poet Sonia Sanchez, journalist Amy Goodman, novelist Alice Walker, Black Lives Matter cofounder Alicia Garza and playwright Eve Ensler seemed as good a way to kill the time and gird one’s loins as any. Hearing hyper-intelligent, super-activist thinkers giving rousing speeches (in a house dedicated to Black excellence) was something I desperately needed right before the storm. But that this audience knew how to get their groove on when the music played was just important because, as Alice Walker told the crowd (and as those queens who staged a “queer dance party” outside Mike Pence’s home on Wednesday showed), these times call for “serious dancing.” Neither Trump nor even Obama were evoked much at the Peace Ball. Instead, the party was a bittersweet meditation on peace through poetry, speeches and dance. I recalled how, just months into his presidency, the Nobel Prize committee had such high hopes for Obama as a pacifist that they awarded him the Nobel Peace Prize, inviting comparisons of him to Martin Luther King. Obama’s record on actual peacemaking was not Kingsian, though. Angela Davis told me when I asked her about his legacy that she was disappointed he did not fulfil a campaign promise to eradicate a potent symbol of American violence: “Ten years later, Guantanamo is still open.” Last year, the commander-in-chief’s military dropped 26,171 bombs abroad. Back in the United States – despite his task force on policing – Obama was unable to stop American cops killing more than a thousand people a year. “As we challenge police violence,” Davis told me, “we also have to challenge military violence,” both of which will likely get worse with Trump. Every cabinet pick convinces me that they’re ready to enact violence by reducing access to medicine, drinkable water, clean air, economic justice, and education. The Republican plan to reportedly cut $10tn in spending over 10 years will unleash enormous violence upon the most vulnerable. Davis told me she is “trying to retain a measure of optimism about prospects for the future,” given that “there have been many expressions of young people and older people who are clearly recognizing that if we are to survive the next four years, it will only be as a result of accelerated and intensified struggle.” Davis was just one of the peaceful warriors, mostly women of color, throughout the night who gave me life in thinking about how to face an angry, mean, vindictive, white misogynist. Amy Goodman took the stage to passionately declare this an exciting era to cover social movements addressing climate change (such as the press and water victories at Standing Rock) and the need for independent journalism and “a media that is the fourth estate, not for the state.” Sonia Sanchez rapped a poem that put Trump-inspired poetry to shame, remixing DuBois’ quote that “the cause of war is preparation of war” as “the cause of peace is the preparation of peace.” Naomi Klein said that Trumpism coming at us from many ways at once means “they’re going to unite us” and that “we have to fight these bastards as if life itself depended on it - because it does.” If Obama failed to have as much fight in him for peace and against white supremacy as we’d hoped, these women made up for it. Before I left the party, I wandered up into the Blacksonian galleries, which were quiet and mostly empty I lingered in front of Aaron Douglas’ 1927 painting, The Creation, which “depicts Adam from the Book of Genesis as a black man looking up to the hand of God”. But unlike Michelangelo’s early 16th century fresco The Creation of Adam the hand of God in Douglas’ painting is large, foreboding, high above and untouchable. Douglas’ Black Adam looks abandoned on the Earth – a sentiment I could empathize with as a Black gay man on the eve of President Trump. I then wandered over to Kevin Cole’s 2008 piece Increase Risk with Emotional Faith in which the artist depicts a tree his grandfather took him to where Black men “were routinely lynched for trying to vote,” their neckties tied around the noose as “a warning to other black men that African Americans should not aspire to the status or privileges of white people.” This work made me think there is little reason to increase risk for emotional faith in American institutions, as they have historically failed Black people– and soon may fail most of the 99%. Thank God, though, for the words of the peace warriors I heard last night – for dance, for the love of friends, for black brilliance and resistance. These are only things which make me feel less alone in this American moment."
22,2017-01-20T17:01:21Z,News,The full text of Donald Trump's inauguration speech,"The president spoke of ‘American carnage’ and painted a dark picture of the US, and calls for ‘total allegiance to the United States of America’Trump’s speech – what you need to know","Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you. We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done. Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you. Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people. For too long, a small group in our nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered – but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country. What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation – and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military; we’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own; and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world. But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first, America first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams. We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: buy American and hire American. We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth. At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us: “How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.” We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God. Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights, and heal our divisions. It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator. So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And, yes, together, we will make America great again. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."

Hillary Clinton stood stoic on Friday as the man she defeated by 2.9m votes took the oath of office. She was steadfast, just as she had been in the presidential debates where the soon-to-be victor, Donald J Trump, threatened repeatedly to jail her. She was not rattled as chants of “lock her up” emanated from the crowd below the inauguration podium, and betrayed no emotion as Trump, who defeated her with an electoral college win, declared an end to the era of politicians who were “all talk and no action”. The seating arrangements kept Clinton off camera through most of the ceremony, when the focus was instead on Trump, across the aisle, and Barack Obama, who sat one row ahead of her, to the right. After Trump’s inaugural address, the president shook hands with his predecessors, bringing him within inches of Hillary Clinton, but the pair were separated by a large man, who blocked the two from making eye contact. They eventually interacted with a handshake at the inaugural luncheon. Before the ceremony, cameras found Clinton backstage, taking a deep breath as she prepared to join the audience. As she waited for the ceremony to begin, Clinton spoke with former president George W Bush. The two later leaned into each other as they exited the main stage. Clinton adhered to tradition and attended the ceremony as a former first lady. She was dressed in a white suit similar to the one she wore at the Democratic convention last summer in Philadelphia, a time when she looked to be the favorite to win the White House and make history as the first female president. It’s seen as an homage to the suffragettes, who were encouraged to wear white at marches in the early 1900s. “I’m here today to honor our democracy &amp; its enduring values,” Clinton tweeted just before Trump was sworn in. “I will never stop believing in our country &amp; its future”. It is not the first time the losing candidate has had a front row seat to their rival’s inauguration: Richard Nixon and Al Gore attended their rivals’ ceremonies as the outgoing vice-presidents. And Clinton attended Barack Obama’s first inauguration, after he defeated her in the Democratic primary. The chasm between Trump and Clinton, however, was wider than those previous electoral rivalries. Trump threatened to jail Clinton during the second presidential debate. That same night, Clinton said that Trump was the first Republican nominee for president whom she thought was “unfit to serve”. Clinton is a former secretary of state, lauded New York state senator and two-term first lady. Trump has never held elected office. She was the first female presidential candidate nominated by a major party, while he bragged about groping women without their consent in a 2005 video released one month before the election. Addressing both Hillary and Bill Clinton at the inaugural luncheon on Friday, Trump said he was “honored” they even attended the inauguration. “I think it’s very important,” Trump told the luncheon. “And I’d like you to stand up. I’d like you to stand up.” The Clintons stood and were soon joined by the other guests, who applauded. “And honestly, there’s nothing more I can say, because I have great respect for those two people,” Trump said. Since her defeat on 8 November Clinton has been spotted walking her dog in the woods near her home in upstate New York, speaking to donors and seeing The Color Purple on Broadway with her daughter, Chelsea. Less than a month after her devastating loss, she resumed her political duties. She spoke at a portrait unveiling ceremony for the retiring Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, in December. “This is not exactly the speech at the Capitol I hoped to be giving after the election,” she said. Clinton left Friday’s ceremony amid a sea of former presidents and first ladies, waving to the crowd and smiling broadly as the ceremony came to an end."

He assumes executive authority, and his nuclear launch codes are being activated at a time when there is reported to be a broad, multi-agency investigation into possible collusion between the Kremlin and officials on his campaign. US intelligence agencies have already concluded that Vladimir Putin interfered in the presidential election in Trump’s favour. The night before his inauguration, the New York Times quoted current and former senior US officials as saying that law enforcement and intelligence agencies were examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of their inquiries. On Wednesday, the McClatchy news agency reported that the FBI and five other agencies had been collaborating for months in an investigation into the extent of Russian attempts to skew the election. The report said that investigators were examining how money may have been transferred by the Kremlin in its covert bid to help Trump win. One possibility was that a system used to pay Russian-American pensioners was used to pay email hackers in the US. Once Trump takes the reins of power, however, he has the authority to stop all executive branch investigations. He could replace the FBI director, James Comey, although it is highly unusual for a FBI chief to be fired before the end of his 10-year term. Bill Clinton sacked director William Sessions in 1993, on the basis of an investigation into his conduct carried out under George HW Bush into alleged abuse of office. However, barring evidence of blatant wrongdoing by Comey, any move by Trump to dismiss him while the president’s associates were under investigation would be highly controversial, akin to Richard Nixon’s dismissal of special prosecutor Archibald Cox in 1973. Congress has also launched its own investigations. The Senate intelligence committee announced last week that it planned to interview senior figures in the incoming administration as part of its inquiry into Russian hacking of the election, and a subcommittee of the armed services committee, run by Trump’s Republican nemesis, Senator John McCain, is pursuing a parallel enquiry. On 9 December, McCain personally handed Comey a set of reports alleging the Trump campaign’s collusion with Moscow, compiled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, as part of opposition research conducted by the campaign, although the FBI had first received the reports months earlier. However, according to press reports, the joint investigation was launched before the Steele reports were written, and based on intelligence collected independently by US and allied agencies. The BBC has reported that the justice department was granted a warrant by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) court, in October to monitor two Russian banks suspected of being involved in Moscow’s intervention. The issue of the Fisa warrant was first reported on the eve of the election by former British MP, Louise Mensch, on the Heatstreet news website. The Guardian’s own sources have confirmed the first application for a warrant over the summer, but not the granting of a warrant in October. According to the New York Times, the joint investigation into links with Moscow includes the former Trump campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who had a long history of working for pro-Russian public figures in Ukraine. Manafort did not reply to a Guardian request for comment, but told the New York Times in an email that the allegations of collusion with Moscow were a “Democrat Party dirty trick and completely false.” “I have never had any relationship with the Russian government or any Russian officials. I was never in contact with anyone, or directed anyone to be in contact with anyone,” he said. Manafort stood down from his campaign post in August, but one of his close friends has confirmed to the Guardian that he continues to provide advice to Trump informally."

Trump, the oldest and reportedly least popular man to be sworn into the country’s highest office, takes over a divided country. Protests have already begun and are expected to continue throughout the weekend. It’s also moving day for the Obamas, who will be vacating their home for the past eight years. Guardian US will keep you up to date with all the day’s events in our live blog, pulling in dispatches from reporters who are stationed throughout Washington DC and around the country. It will also take in protests and events throughout the world, including London, Toronto, Sydney, Addis Ababa and more. Donald Trump inauguration: the world holds its breath – live coverage This is how the day will play out (read this for more details): 8.30am: Trump and the incoming vice-president, Mike Pence, will attend a church service at St John’s Episcopal church with their families. 9:40am: Trump and his wife, Melania, will arrive at the White House where they will be greeted by Barack and Michelle Obama. The four will sit down for a private coffee and tea reception in the White House’s regal Blue Room. 10.30am: The Trumps and the Obamas will take the presidential limousine to the West Front of the US Capitol for the ceremony. 11.30am: The inauguration ceremony will begin. 12pm: The chief justice of the supreme court, John Roberts, will administer the presidential oath for Trump, who will then make his inaugural address. 12.45pm: The Obamas will fly off in a helicopter to Andrews airfield. The remainder of the day consists of the inaugural parade, a luncheon and, later in the evening, the inaugural balls. Hillary Clinton will be present at the ceremony, in keeping with tradition that all living former first families attend. Speaking of first families, here’s a look at the new one. However, more than 30 members of Congress will be boycotting the event in protest against Trump. In a column for the Guardian, congresswoman Barbara Lee explains why she won’t be there.

Last night saw fierce clashes in Washington DC in front of the National Press Club, the venue for the DeploraBall, an event hosted to celebrate Trump’s victory (with a name inspired by Clinton’s reference to Trump supporters as a “basket of deplorables”). Many of the guests are believed to be associated with the “alt-right”, a far-right movement in the US that has praised Trump. Protesters were blocked by police but called attendees “fascists” and “racists”. Meanwhile, a host of celebrities attended a protest in New York outside Trump Tower. Alec Baldwin performed his Saturday Night Live impression of the soon-to-be president and rallied the crowd. Amber Jamieson has provided a guide to protests happening today and tomorrow here. DeploraBall: Trump lovers and haters clash at Washington DC event Pre-presidential party Trump delivered a speech on Thursday night in an event dripping with symbolism. Standing on the Lincoln Memorial steps, close to where Martin Luther King declared “I have dream” in 1963, Trump rallied the crowd with “make America great again” chants before a firework display spelled the words U-S-A, as the Battle Hymn of the Republic rang out. Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down performed at the event. On eve of inauguration, Trump addresses nation in shadow of Lincoln ‘We could’ve avoided President Trump’ The road to Trump’s presidency had many alternative routes but we missed all of them, writes Rebecca Solnit. From failing to address climate change to the capitulation of the media, Solnit argues, we’ve missed many off-ramps on the “highway to hell”. “Now we’ve reached the inauguration, in an Oldsmobile with four flat tires and a boiling radiator, some of us are looking ahead, to where the U-turn options are.” We could’ve avoided President Donald Trump. Now, we must learn the lessons Women’s March Come Saturday, a crowd of more than 200,000 is expected to descend on Washington to protest against the Trump presidency. For women who are on the fence, Lucia Graves has outlined 29 reasons to attend the rally on Saturday. However, not every woman was dismayed by Trump’s victory. Rebecca Nelson spoke to conservative women who are glad to see Trump in the White House and have no interest in protesting. Beyond the US, there will be solidarity marches held in more than 17 countries across the globe in protest of Trump’s election. A panel of Guardian writers have explained how they will protest from joining the UK women’s march to talking about sexual assault in Washington. While the march has gained international traction, Micah White, the co-creator of the Occupy Movement, said it takes a lot more than “raising awareness and getting media attention” to start a true revolutionary movement. In his piece for the Guardian, he outlines how the Women’s March could grow into something more sustained beyond Saturday. But it involves knowing one’s history, learning from the past, and taking the fight to the ballot box. And finally … In the wake of Donald Trump’s win – a tremendous political and cultural loss for American women – the Guardian columnist Jessica Valenti will be launching a newsletter, This Week in the Patriarchy.

27,2017-01-20T19:16:00Z,News,What you need to know about Trump's first speech as president,"Guardian US writers examine President Trump’s take on national security, the economy, climate change, healthcare, justice, immigration and gender Trump’s inauguration speech – full text","The economy Donald Trump’s economic nationalism was on full display in his inauguration speech. The president spoke of the “American carnage” he claims has been wrought on America, leaving “rusted out factories scattered like tombstones” across a nation with “little to celebrate”, and blamed it on the outsourcing of US jobs. “America first” will be his presiding philosophy. Those people left behind by the globalization and the deindustrialization of America helped elect Trump and they will be cheered by his message. But who benefitted from this transformation? According to a report published in December by University of California at Berkeley economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the average pre-tax income of the bottom 50% of adults has stagnated since 1980 at about $16,000 per adult while the average pre-tax income of the top 1% rose from $420,000 to about $1.3m. The wealthiest 1% now owns over 37% of household wealth, the bottom 50% – some 160 million people – owns a mere 0.1%. Trump’s supporters can blame outside forces for their feelings of economic insecurity but it is people like Trump and his cabinet, set to be the richest in history, who have been the main beneficiary of the economic forces that have reshaped America. Trump’s supporters will have to trust them to work against their own interests if they want to Make America Great Again. Dominic Rushe Justice Trump continued to position himself as a “law and order” president, painting a stark image of a country ridden with “the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential”. “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,” he pledged. Obama spent the past two and a half years trying to delicately push forward both gun control laws and a fraught debate over how to reduce police violence towards black Americans. He repeatedly emphasized the good work of most police officers, but also refused to dismiss the mistrust and frustration many black Americans feel towards law enforcement. Trump, in contrast, has put himself and his administration squarely in the camp of police unions, who have literally turned their backs when leaders like New York City mayor Bill DeBlasio have decided to treat black American’s concerns about police brutality seriously. Trump famously claimed during the campaign that Chicago police could stop the city’s sudden spike in gun violence “in one week” by “being very much tougher”. “Using tough police tactics,” was the key, he said, “which is OK when people are being killed”. After years of record lows in murder and violent crime, the United States saw a troubling 10.8% uptick in murders in 2015 – the biggest single-year increase in decades, though one that left the number of murders roughly the same they had been in 2009. Experts say it’s too soon to know how serious this increase might be – much less what has caused it. But Trump has selectively taken the worst statistics and waved them like a bloody flag. The new president has made clear that he will take a tough-on-crime stance. despite the building bipartisan consensus that a less-punitive, less-costly criminal justice system is likely to make Americans safer. Lois Beckett National security Of all the striking moments in Donald Trump’s caustic inaugural address, few were more discordant than a president whose associates are under investigation for their connections to a foreign power using “America first” as a slogan. The intelligence agencies that Trump has been feuding with since his electoral victory have concluded Russia interfered in the election for his benefit. They have sought a foreign-intelligence surveillance warrant to examine his associates’ connections to Russia and reportedly are combing through foreign communications and financial transaction records to that end. Additionally, the Senate intelligence committee has initiated an inquiry into the same subject, and has signaled its willingness to subpoena Trump aides. The course of those inquiries will be the backdrop under which Trump conducts US foreign policy and stewards its national security. In his address, which portrayed him as leading the nation out of an era of “American carnage” unleashed by parasitic elites, Trump beat a loud nationalist drum. Every foreign capital will soon learn, “it’s only going to be America first”, Trump said. His only sop to a universalist vision of America was to say that every nation has the right to similarly place their interests first. Trump alluded to forging new alliances – a seeming reference to his oft-stated desire to bring the US closer to Russia – in order to “unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.” While moments earlier, Trump lamented the loss of “trillions of dollars” through wasteful foreign conflicts, he set a rhetorical commitment to an expansive war against an undifferentiated adversary. For years, the far right has argued that only a willingness to blame an amorphous concept called “radical Islam” – often conflated with Islam itself, and understood that way by millions of Muslims in the US and worldwide – can precipitate a victorious conclusion to the 9/11 era. They are about to have their test case in president Trump. “It’s going to be America first” is a statement that conceals more than it reveals, particularly on national security. While Trump offered few specifics, he criticized the US “subsidiz[ing] the armies of foreign countries while allowing the depletion of our own military”. That “subsidy” is the “by, with and through” approach to training foreign militaries that gave Barack Obama’s Pentagon an alternative to the ponderous ground warfare Trump first embraced in Iraq and then repudiated. Several of those armies, including Kurdish peshmerga irregulars, Iraqi soldiers, Syrian rebels and Libyan government forces – Muslims all – comprise the forces fighting the Islamic State across Mosul, on the approaches to Raqqa and in Sirte. An early test of Trump’s stewardship will come when he decides whether to revoke such subsidies or jettison his inaugural rhetoric. Spencer Ackerman Health Trump was inaugurated with just a nod to one promise he campaigned on – making America’s healthcare great again. Though Trump devoted portions of his dark speech to crime, trade, immigration, jobs and even gangs, his only reference to American’s struggles to afford their healthcare was a promise to “to free the Earth from the miseries of disease”. However, if the new president is interested in fulfilling promises to listen to the American people made during his speech, he might take a second look at Congressional Republican’s plan to repeal Barack Obama’s signature health law, the Affordable Care Act. Only 20% of the public wants Congress to repeal the ACA without a replacement in hand, according to a January Kaiser Family Foundation poll. Another 47% don’t want the law repealed at all, and a remaining 28% want a plan first. But, so far, Republicans have been coy with details. Trump’s speech did touch on one specific health problem: addiction. “The crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential,” said Trump. “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.” In fact, there is one significant reform that helped cover millions of Americans’ addiction treatment – the Affordable Care Act. Jessica Glenza Climate Unsurprisingly given its anonymity during the election, there was no mention of climate change or the environment in Donald Trump’s inauguration speech. He mentioned mountains and oceans, but only in context of locations in America that will be great again once he solves all of its maladies. Trump did mention the US foolishly spending “trillions of dollars overseas” which partly references climate spending that the new president wants to axe. Barack Obama managed to push $500m out of the door for developing countries threatened by rising seas and droughts in his final week in office. Further assistance is now unlikely. Most telling was what was happening off-stage. The White House website’s expansive section on climate change has now been deleted. In its stead is an “America first energy plan” in which Trump promises to scrap the “harmful and unnecessary” climate action plan. This move, as well as Trump’s speech, is a clear indication the president will simply ignore climate change, as if it does not exist, during his term. Oliver Milman Immigration President Trump referred to border protection three times throughout his short inauguration speech, a sure sign of the emphasis he will place upon it as he attempts to enforce the draconian immigration reforms he pledged on the campaign trail. “We’ve defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own,” Trump said. Critics would argue the remark is patently false. The Obama administration deported more undocumented immigrants than any before it, and took significant measures to secure America’s southern border. Now the majority of migrants crossing the southern border come from Central America, many of whom are women and children seeking asylum from violence and instability in the region. Trump has also pledged to suspend America’s intake of Syrian refugees, who are already subjected to substantial security vetting before they enter the country, and it seems likely the president will move forward with this promise within the next few days. Coupled with Trump’s infamous promise to erect a wall across the entire southern border, it remains unclear just how much damage he will do to some of the world’s most vulnerable people in the name of border defense. Oliver Laughland Gender Trump didn’t mention gender issues in his inaugural speech. But in the days leading up to his swearing-in, his transition team unveiled a plan to eliminate $480m in Violence Against Women grants and his nomination for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, refused to commit to upholding the Obama administration’s aggressive stance on campus sexual assault or the rights of trans students. Republicans in Congress have moved swiftly to repeal Obamacare, which expanded contraception access and prohibited insurers from charging women more for health care, and to cut off Planned Parenthood’s participation in Medicaid.

A new first family will have taken their place. Here’s a bit about the Trumps, with notes on the roles each family member may play in the administration. Melania Trump, 46 Wife of Donald. Born Melanija Knavs in Slovenia in eastern Europe, she was sufficiently successful as a model that she sometimes worked under only her first name, and toiled as an undocumented immigrant in the United States before landing a work visa in 1997, according to an Associated Press investigation. She met her future husband at a Fashion Week party in New York City. The couple will celebrate their 12th anniversary on 22 January, two days after he becomes president. She has said that as first lady she would like to be “very traditional – like Betty Ford or Jackie Kennedy”. She also plans to combat online bullying and harassment. She will remain in New York City through the end of the school year with her son with Trump, Barron, 10, and is expected to play a minimal role in the administration. Donald Trump Jr, 39 Donald Trump’s eldest son, he is himself a father of five, with his wife, Vanessa Kay Haydon, a former model. A reality TV star (The Apprentice) like his father, he has been tapped to head the Trump Organization – the family business empire – with his brother, Eric, aided by a longtime company executive. Trump Jr is not expected to have a role in his father’s administration; indeed, his new position as co-head of the Trump Organization would seem to preclude, under ethics rules and traditions, his speaking with his father about the business and his hearing from his father about government. Trump Jr drew ire during the campaign for agreeing to an interview with a prominent white nationalist and for comparing Syrian refugees to Skittles. He is a big-game hunter and self-described “boob guy”. Eric Trump, 33 Trump’s second-oldest son, he has also appeared on The Apprentice and is married to Lara Trump, née Yunaska, a fitness trainer and TV producer. With his brother, Don Jr, Eric is to lead the Trump Organization, and is due to have no role in the Trump administration. He runs a charitable foundation to fight childhood cancer, but claims he has made about his father personally donating large sums to the foundation, like many Trump family claims about charitable giving, could not be verified. Like his brother, he is a big-game hunter. Ivanka Trump, 35 Trump’s eldest daughter, and like Don Jr and Eric the daughter of her father’s first wife Ivana, a Czech-born former fashion model. Ivanka converted to Orthodox Judaism to marry businessman Jared Kushner, with whom she has three children. She is a fashion executive and like her brothers has appeared on The Apprentice. As an executive with the Trump organization, she managed projects including the recently opened Trump hotel in the Old Post Office building in downtown Washington DC, but she has said she will divest from the family company, owing to her husband’s role in the Trump administration. The nature of her divestment is not clear; it has been described by Trump transition officials as “converting” her equity into fixed payments. Ivanka Trump has rebutted speculation that she would act as a de facto first lady. “I think it’s an inappropriate observation,” she told ABC News. “There is one first lady, and she’ll do remarkable things.” Jared Kushner, 36 Husband of Ivanka Trump. Raised in New Jersey and the grandchild of Holocaust survivors, he has a bachelor’s degree from Harvard and a law degree from New York University. He took over his family’s real estate firm after his father was imprisoned on a federal felony conviction for witness tampering and tax evasion. Kushner is also owner and publisher of the New York Observer, and has said he is in the process of withdrawing from both the real estate firm and the newspaper as part of his transition to senior adviser to his father-in-law. Despite his lack of political experience, he played a key behind-the-scenes role in Trump’s presidential campaign, guiding personnel and strategy decisions, and will play the role of senior adviser to the president in the Trump White House, presuming he is not found to have breached federal anti-nepotism laws. Marla Maples and Tiffany Trump Maples, 53, a former model and actress, is Trump’s second wife and the mother of his fourth child, Tiffany, 23. Maples is now an activist and singer-songwriter, while Tiffany is a recent college graduate. Neither is expected to have a role in the Trump administration."
29,2017-01-20T20:33:22Z,News,'I feel nauseous': undocumented students fearful after Trump's speech,"Reaction to inauguration speech trumpeting ‘America first’ was met with mixed reviews across the country, with some cheering him for touting ‘the right way’Donald Trump inauguration – live coverage","Miriam Avilez hid her face in her hands as she watched Donald Trump begin to deliver his inauguration speech on a laptop. “I feel nauseous. I can’t look at him,” said Avilez, a 27-year-old undocumented student. “Everything we’ve fought for, all the victories we’ve had, in one day are basically taken away.” Avilez gathered with other immigrant student activists at the University of California, Berkeley, on Friday to prepare for a morning of “teach-ins” aimed at organizing against Trump and his “harmful” agenda. Crowded inside a diversity office at the school of public health, the students, including some who are undocumented and have relied on the protections of Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) policy, were near tears after Trump’s speech ended. “I felt like he wasn’t talking me, he wasn’t talking about my family, he wasn’t talking about my community,” said Johanna Figueroa, 25. “Who are you talking to? Who are you representing?” At Trump Cafe in Bellville, Texas, a self-described American-born Hispanic woman took a different view of Trump’s immigration rhetoric. “I feel for all [immigrants], but there’s a right way and a wrong way and that’s what I feel he’s trying to make Americans understand,” said Linda Myers, 66, a small-business owner. Myers, wearing a stars and stripes flag as a scarf, said Trump’s speech was “very, very moving. If it doesn’t bring our country together, I don’t think there’s anything that can be done. It was moving, it hit where it needed to hit.” Myers sat with other patrons who piled in to eat lunch, watch the inauguration on television and buy Trump-themed merchandise at the establishment owned by Muslim immigrants. Tables in the function room were laid out ready for two large parties of celebrating Trump supporters. The owners, from Jerusalem, emigrated separately to the US and met in Chicago. About two weeks before the presidential election in November, they renamed their small-town Texas cafe in honor of Donald Trump. After the change, Eddie Hawa, 46, said he had some critical, even threatening, phone calls from people from outside Texas – but the locals in this county of fewer than 30,000 people, an hour’s drive west of Houston, were overwhelmingly supportive. Trump won here with 79% of the vote. “He’s a businessman and we need businessmen,” said Su Hawa, 28. “He’s a smart man, he’s very smart. I’m so glad he’s right now our president, I’m so excited.” But as Muslims, are they not worried by talk that Trump may institute a registry or travel ban? “He was talking in general, not individual people. I think what he’s saying, any president would say it – anybody who comes to the United States, you have to go through the system to become a citizen or resident,” Eddie Hawa said. “He was talking about Isis, he wasn’t talking about people living here.” Many opponents made it a point to boycott watching the inauguration altogether, whether because they were outside protesting or just watching another channel, hoping to drive down Trump’s television ratings. “I for one am actively not watching it. And what I mean by actively not watching it, I’m going to be turning on something else,” said Floyd Rumohr, who heads of the Brooklyn Community Pride Center in New York. Janson Wu, the executive director of GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders (Glad), was at the Creating Change Conference in Philadelphia during the inauguration ceremony. The conference is held at a hotel, and Wu said the inauguration was nearly impossible to avoid on the televisions there, but he was choosing not to watch. “Being among such a diverse group of activists and advocates reminds me of why we do this work and gives me energy to go forward,” he said. “I can’t imagine anywhere else I’d rather be on inauguration day.” In Atlanta, Georgia, protestors said they would rely on news reports to learn about what Trump said, but would stop short of watching the man talk. “No, I won’t watch it,” said Patricia Cofie, unemployed. “I’ll watch the news. That’s about as much as I can take.” In Berkeley, Sofia Villagomez, 23, said it was a struggle to force herself to even watch the event. “God help us all,” said the public health student, part of a group called Borders and Bodies Collective. “I’m just feeling like I need to be informed about what’s going as much as what’s happening just pains me. We’re headed for a fight, for sure.” Gladis Chavez, a 26-year-old undocumented student, said the reports that Trump may immediately repeal Daca, which could put students like her at risk of deportation, were heavily weighing on her. “It really scares me. I don’t know what I’m going to do if I lose everything I’ve been working for.”. Since the election, activists at the University of California’s progressive Berkeley campus – famous for its 1960s civil rights protests known as the free speech movement – have pressured the university to be a “sanctuary” for undocumented people. “Our lives were just used for political gain,” said Chavez, who was born in Mexico and came to the US aged two. “Our lives are just not valued. We’re all under attack. I feel like I’ve done everything I can do to show I belong here.”"
30,2017-01-20T19:29:05Z,News,What's inside the Tiffany box? Imagining Melania Trump's gift to the Obamas,What did the new first lady give to Barack and Michelle Obama shortly before her husband was sworn in as president? Here are some possible options,"Melania Trump turned up at the White House on inauguration day clutching a gift for the outgoing president and first lady, that recognizable robin egg blue box with a white ribbon signifying a purchase from Tiffany &amp; Co. Tiffany &amp; Co have a store in the lobby of Manhattan’s Trump Tower, so it’s an unsurprising store choice from the Trumps. She gave the gift to Michelle Obama, who graciously accepted it, before an aide took it away. But what could be inside the box? Tiffany said in a statement: “The White House has been a patron of the House of Tiffany &amp; Co since Abraham Lincoln,” which doesn’t answer our question. So here are some possible options from their online store. U-shaped key ring - $3,000 A $3,000 key ring to store the keys for the Obamas’ new Washington home, in the same neighborhood as favorite Trump daughter Ivanka. Gaudy and cliched (it’s one of Tiffany’s most famous items), making it a likely option. Vegetable spoon – $350 A silver spoon, just like the one Trump was born with! Plus, it’s a vegetable spoon to keep Mobama happy. Airplane bank – $2,500 To help the Obamas save up for their own personal jet, since they have now lost Air Force One. Plus, a $2,500 piggy bank makes about as much logical sense as a man with no government experience becoming president. Fifth Ave mug – $25 So that every morning over coffee, the Obamas can remember where the White House is located now. Ship’s clock – $2,800 A clock in Trump’s favorite hue, to help them count down the hours until this is all over. Tiffany playing cards – $35 Obama calls himself a “pretty good poker player” and now he’ll have lots of time to practice. The black and white cards may have some symbolic value. Elephant moneybank – $25 To remind Obama of how much money he had to save after the Republicans left the country penniless last time they were in control. Pineapple Dish – $350 A pineapple dish as a tribute to Obama’s home state … Kenya. Canned pineapple is the country’s largest single manufactured export, making this an appropriate gift from the man who led the Birther movement. Hawaii has a lot of pineapples, too, so Trump can tell the media that’s what he was alluding to."
31,2017-01-20T18:04:44Z,Opinion,The Guardian view on Donald Trump’s inauguration: a declaration of political war,"The presidential handover observed all the usual civilities, but the tone of Trump’s speech marked a frightening change in America","In its outward details, the orderly transfer of American presidential power accomplished in the inauguration-day scene on Capitol Hill today felt time-honoured. The ceremonial essentials of the occasion – the stars and stripes banners, the dignitaries and the prescribed rituals of the swearings-in – were familiar and traditional. Political rivals took their places on the podium as they do every four years, shook hands and applauded one another, offering gracious compliments and providing a show of national dignity. Yet all this was in fact a sham. Donald Trump’s inaugural address was a declaration of war on everything represented by these choreographed civilities. President Trump – it’s time to begin to get used to those jarringly ill-fitting words – did not conjure a deathless phrase for the day. His words will not lodge in the brain in any of the various uplifting ways that the likes of Lincoln, Roosevelt, Kennedy or Reagan once achieved. But the new president’s message could not have been clearer. He came to shatter the veneer of unity and continuity represented by the peaceful handover. And he may have succeeded. In 1933, Roosevelt challenged the world to overcome fear. In 2017, Mr Trump told the world to be very afraid. Mr Trump’s speech was by turns bitter, blowhard and banal. It boiled with resentment and contempt for politics, and the checks and balances of the US system. It was aimed at those who voted for him, not at those, the majority, who did not. It said barely a word about race. Its America First nationalism was crude and shameless. The speech seethed with scorn for everything about the capital city that he now seeks to bend to his will. It was, though, almost wholly empty of detail or of clarity about how its goals would be achieved. Even before he opened his mouth, Washington was on edge about what a Trump presidency might mean and the world was on edge about what is happening to America. Everything Mr Trump said confirmed that those instincts were correct. Presidents have often come into office promising to take the nation on a new path. But if Mr Trump can be believed, his election and his speech signal the biggest shake-up in Washington in living memory. The vital question for the future is whether Mr Trump can be believed. In his speech he mocked those who have been all talk and no action. But there is a risk he could be a victim of that too. He raised the bar for his own presidency to a very high level by insisting that everything would change “right here, right now”. But will it? The power of the presidency has grown over the decades, and the 2016 election has now put the Republicans in charge of all the arms of government. But Mr Trump is not, at least not yet, a dictator. He has to govern with a Congress that does not share all his priorities – in some cases, Mr Trump’s priorities may even be preferable – and according to law that is interpreted by the courts. The states have a lot of power to defy him, as California seems determined to do in the case of the planned wall with Mexico. It has been argued that voters chose Mr Trump knowing that he would challenge the system, but confident that the system would protect the voters from the worst consequences. That may prove right. But Mr Trump should not be underestimated. He is a proud disrupter not a diffident conformist. He is – and intends to be – different from the presidents of the past: in his personality, his working style, his ways of communicating and, most important of all, in his political aims. Those who support him and those who fear him are agreed on that. Yet he has arrived in the White House with low ratings and amid a deep sense of division. His inauguration was boycotted by several leaders and will be protested against by tens of thousands. His attempts to overturn America’s political hierarchy and culture will enthuse some – the stock market is thrumming – but terrify others. The realities of Mr Trump’s disruptive intentions will be revealed in the weeks and months ahead. The first downpayments on his turbulent agenda can be found on the White House website. Domestically, the biggest programme will be the infrastructure projects that formed the only detailed pledge of the inaugural address. Beyond America’s shores, much is still guesswork: the probable clash with China poses the biggest threat of all; whether Mr Trump gets his way on Russia may depend on his more sceptical cabinet. “The time for empty talk is over,” said President Trump today. “Now arrives the hour of action.” At home and abroad, and in the light of today’s speech, that is a truly terrifying prospect."
32,2017-01-20T18:02:32Z,News,Trump's first speech in office was unapologetic appeal to nationalism,Braggart and bigot now in control of the world’s most powerful military and economy. Fear and malevolence won,"Even the heavens wept. As Donald Trump stepped forward to become America’s 45th president the cold shower that broke over Washington offered no end of metaphors. His address, however, was literal to a fault. There was no higher calling, no sense of a greater purpose, no florid imagery or impassioned idealism. This was as crude and unapologetic an appeal to nationalism as one might expect from a man incapable of rising to an occasion without first refracting it through his ego. It is said that presidents campaign in poetry and govern in prose. Trump campaigned in graffiti – the profane scrawls of a mindless vandal – and, if his inaugural address was anything to go by, may yet govern in tweets – the impulsive, abbreviated interventions of a narcissist. Were this a reality TV show, we would have switched off by now. All the better qualified, more sympathetic and empathic characters have been eliminated. The last man standing is a scheming, pathological misanthrope whose disrespect for the rules alone should have disqualified him. The producer would have been fired; the advertisers would have bolted. Nobody in their right mind would want anything to do with it. But there is a difference between reality TV and something surreal that you can watch on TV. From the robed supreme court chief justice holding aloft Lincoln’s Bible for Trump to swear on to the gathering of former presidents, the entire purpose of an inauguration is to celebrate a mature democracy. As the White House is bequeathed to the popular choice, it’s intended to symbolise continuity and stability – a common destiny in a shared polity. Friday achieved the opposite. To watch Trump take the oath was to bear witness to democracy’s fragility. It marked not simply the transfer of power from one leader to another but the erosion of the very values that give that power legitimacy. That frailty stems not from any question about whether Trump won the election but how he won it and what that victory portends. There is more to democracy than elections and more to elections than simply voting. Democratic traditions are underpinned by norms that he not only disregarded (on that score he would not be the first) but brazenly and gleefully violated – advocating violence at his rallies, haranguing the media, fuelling racial animus, religious exclusion and misogyny. As such, his inauguration represents an indictment of an entire political culture. It leaves condemned a Democratic party that could not defeat him, a Republican party that would not disown him, a mainstream media that failed to scrutinise him and a social media that spread his lies far faster than any scrutiny could travel. All were found wanting. Now all will be tested. This is no local problem. Those who take to the streets across the globe to demonstrate Trump’s presidency over the next few days would do well to stay there and resist his counterparts in their own backyards. Where this particular threat to democracy is concerned, America is by no means exceptional. In Washington, the moment was all the more disorienting because of what it replaced. Barack Obama’s approval ratings are higher now than they have been for some time, reminding us of the stratospheric expectations of that freezing January day when he first took office eight years ago. It’s as though his presence could never compete with his promise or his passing. To watch him accompany Trump through the process was to see the civility of pageantry triumph over the candour of politics. Several of those with front-row seats, from both parties, had concluded Trump was unfit for the office he now holds. “When making life or death or war or peace decisions,” Michelle Obama said six weeks before election day, “a president just can’t pop off or lash out irrationally … If a candidate traffics in fear and lies on the campaign trail … well that is the kind of president they will be.” That is the president who was sworn in on Friday. No amount of pomp and finery can mask that. That is why what was billed as a ceremony felt more akin to a charade. It is also why many in the US, and beyond, are not simply concerned about what comes next; they are genuinely terrified. An impulsive braggart and bigot is now in control of the world’s most powerful military and economy. Fear and malevolence won. The hands that once grabbed pussy now have access to the nuclear launch codes."
33,2017-01-20T19:53:00Z,News,White House website switches over to Trump's 'America-first' policy agenda,The Obama administration’s priorities of civil rights and climate change were replaced with ‘bringing back jobs and growth’ and ‘rebuild American military’,"At the moment the presidency was transferred to Donald Trump from Barack Obama, a digital transfer of power also took place online: the White House website was dramatically reorganized on Friday, to emphasize the incoming administration’s priorities.Just a couple of minutes after Trump was sworn in, Obama’s policies were moved to an archival website and promptly replaced with a new slate of priorities, which drastically underscored the differences between the two men’s administrations. Where Obama’s White House website housed information on civil rights, climate change, LGBT rights, healthcare, immigration, education and the “Iran Deal” among others, Trump’s White House website, instead, lists just six “issues”. “America first energy plan” has replaced climate change as a priority, while “Bringing back jobs and growth” focuses on lowering taxes. Civil rights has been replaced with “Standing up with our law enforcement community” and emphasizes the “lawlessness” of illegal immigration and inner cities. The White House website spells out a bit more of what the incoming administration means by an “America first foreign policy”. The phrase used is “peace through strength” which involves a pledge to “rebuild the American military”. The online statement notes that the US navy has shrunk from 500 to 275 ships over the past 15 years and that the air force has been reduced by a third over the same period. It pledges that the new president “is committed to reversing this trend, because he knows that our military dominance must be unquestioned”. The statement avoids stating goals however. For example, there is no repeat of the campaign pledge to boost the navy to 350 ships. Defeating the Islamic State and other “radical Islamic terror groups” is named as the first foreign policy priority, which will be achieved through “joint and coalition military operations”, working with international partners to cut off funding, expanded intelligence sharing, and offensive cyberwarfare targeted on terrorist propaganda and recruiting. There is talk of allies being welcome, but nothing specific about upholding existing alliances like Nato. On trade, the issue titled “Trade Deals Working For All Americans”, there is a pledge to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Area is held off for the time being, pending renegotiation. The website statement warns: “If our partners refuse a renegotiation that gives American workers a fair deal, then the President will give notice of the United States’ intent to withdraw from NAFTA.” In another move undertaken immediately after the transfer of power, the men also updated their respective Twitter accounts. Now, the @POTUS handle belongs to Trump (who at the time of this writing, had yet to tweet), and Obama moved his social media and all previous tweets to @POTUS44."
34,2017-01-20T01:57:44Z,News,China eyes an opportunity to take ownership of climate change fight,The economic and environmental cost of pollution will drive Beijing’s policies regardless of what Donald Trump does,"Twenty years ago, climate change was believed by many in Beijing to be a conspiracy cooked up by the western world to contain China’s development. Since then, China has performed an about-turn, not only recognising climate change as a major global challenge but also, ahead of Davos this week, vowing to lead the world’s effort in combating it. The election of Donald Trump, who, labelling climate change a “hoax” created by China, has reversed the conspiracy, casts a dark shadow on the prospect of future international climate cooperation. But for China, now could be a moment of opportunity. Since the catastrophic Copenhagen failure in 2009, China has anchored climate actions at the core of its political agenda. There are three main reasons for this, and over the next four years, they will be the drivers that will propel China’s climate action forward regardless of the political situation in the US. First, the calculus of cost and benefit has shifted. For a long time, environmental protection was positioned on the opposite side of economic prosperity – the pursuit of one could only sacrifice the other. In China, this binary has fallen apart, as the enormous health impacts of air pollution have galvanised both political and public opinion against polluting industry, and as the booming clean energy industry shows the possibility to make both environmentally and economically sound investments. Second, China feels an increased – and increasing – sense of global responsibility, as displayed in phrase after phrase of Xi Jinping’s speeches in Davos and Geneva this week. Beijing was quick to learn from its mistakes in Copenhagen. In the run up to the Paris conference, it managed to forge consensus on the most difficult political questions with other key players ahead of time. Many of these political breakthroughs, such as on common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) and the issue of transparency, will require China to move beyond its previous positions and take more ambitious action. In addition, China has started to implement its own south-south cooperation scheme, aimed at helping other developing countries to pursue climate action. China is slowly but surely re-defining its international responsibilities and shifting to a more active and cooperation oriented climate diplomacy. Third, China’s leaders have started to take ownership of combating climate change. This new dynamic could bear promising prospects over the next few years. US-China cooperation on climate in the Obama era helped to elevate climate change to the very top of the Chinese leadership’s agenda. This has ensured the unprecedented direct engagement of the Chinese leaders for multiple years, and not only familiarised them with the technicality and politics of climate change, but also allowed them to see the strategic value it can generate. With Xi soon entering his second five-year tenure, he might well take a leaf out of the outgoing US president’s book and try to secure climate action as one of his political legacies. This could mean further investment in and greater leadership on climate action. These three reasons, coupled with the fundamental trend of China’s economic transition and the associated coal consumption decline, present a real opportunity for China to project further international leadership on climate change. What China urgently needs now is a comprehensive strategy that sets climate change as a diplomatic priority. For the past years, China’s policy circle primarily considered climate change through the lens of managing US-China relations and as an issue subordinate to the most important bilateral relationship in the world. As the political winds shift in Washington, climate change now deserves an independent strategy that takes into account but is not dependent on the US-China relationship. Chinese leaders should be confident in such an approach and not underestimate the country’s potential for global leadership. The establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the One Belt, One Road initiative both demonstrate that, when the issue is given political priority, China is not only able to participate in international diplomacy, but can also actively lead. None of these is to say China should step in for the US. Climate change is a crisis larger than any single country. And it is neither feasible nor fair to expect other countries to fill the hole left by the US. But for China, if what it takes to move from a climate villain to a reluctant leader is the short five years of the first half of this decade, it is not completely unreasonable to expect the country to become a true leader by the end of this decade. As Trump drops Obama’s legacy, Xi might well establish one of his own. Li Shuo is Greenpeace’s east Asia senior climate policy adviser based in Beijing."
35,2017-01-20T18:14:31Z,News,Protesters barricade Uber offices: 'No business as usual' on inauguration day,Activists hold signs attacking company that ‘collaborates with Trump’ as protests are staged at other sites around San Francisco Protesters attempt to disrupt inaugural events in Washington,"Anti-Trump protesters barricaded the headquarters of Uber in San Francisco on Friday morning to call attention to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s “collaboration” with the new administration on Trump’s inauguration day. Protesters blocked traffic outside the ride-hailing company’s main office with a giant banner reading: “Uber collaborates with Trump”, while others used PVC piping and chains to blockade the entrances to the building. “Travis Kalanick is collaborating with the Trump administration by being part of Trump’s advisory council,” said Sarah Nelson, one of the protesters. Kalanick, along with Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, and other business magnates, joined the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum following the election. “If the Trump regime follows the same policies as Uber, then we’re all in for a very bad four years,” she added. Uber has long faced criticism for classifying its drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, a distinction that prevents them from unionizing or receiving benefits such as the minimum wage, overtime, and workers’ compensation. On Thursday, the company agreed to pay $20m to settle a Federal Trade Commission claim that it misled drivers over how much they would earn. “As a company we’re committed to working with government on issues that affect riders, drivers and the cities where we operate,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement responding to the protest. “Just as we worked with the Obama Administration, we’ll work with the Trump Administration, too.” Other protesters said they wanted to draw attention to how the tech industry and sharing economy companies have gentrified San Francisco and exploited workers. “What we are seeing from the Trump administration is that corporate America and the government of the United States of America is becoming one and the same,” said Brihannala Morgan, a 35-year-old environmental campaigner protesting outside the Uber headquarters. “The companies throwing support to Donald Trump are showing they don’t share the values of San Francisco or the United States.” Morgan said it appeared that 16 people were arrested, though she was not taken into custody. She noted that she was recently priced out of San Francisco and noted that Uber has helped contribute to rising rents and displacement. “Having organizations like Uber come in buying huge office spaces in low-income communities is hiking up rent prices and is just fundamentally opposed to the values we have in the Bay Area,” she said, adding, “Uber is replacing strong union jobs that are poor paying and make below minimum wage and don’t provide security.” Dana Perls, a 36-year-old nonprofit worker, said, “Uber is supporting Trump and Uber is destroying the fabric of the Bay Area … Uber has done the opposite of investing in the community.” She noted that Uber drivers don’t earn enough to sustain a family. “We want business in California and across the country to support people and not to support a fascist leader like Trump.” The Uber protest was one of several around San Francisco on Friday morning. Protesters also blocked the Wells Fargo headquarters, a financial district building partially owned by Trump, and the tracks of Caltrain, a commuter railway that connects San Francisco with Silicon Valley. The San Francisco police department did not have details on arrests or charges against any of the protesters, but said a “mass arrest” had occurred at the Uber protest. Officers remained stationed outside the office after the arrests. Protesters plastered signs on a nearby building that read: “Uber collaborates. We resist.” “I apologize to the Uber employees that attempted to get into the building today,” said Nelson. “We understand that people are trying to work, but today there is no business as usual.”"
36,2017-01-20T17:28:19Z,News,Obama departs White House with a promise: 'I'll be right there with you',"After eight years as America’s first black president, Obama handed over the White House to Trump – but not before tweeting last thoughtsThanks, Obama: how the president’s supporters spent his last day in office","With barely a flicker to betray the emotions of the day, Barack and Michelle Obama stepped out of the White House at 10.50am on Friday for the last time as president and first lady of the United States. After eight historic years as America’s first black president, Obama departed 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and prepared to hand over the keys not to America’s first female president in Hillary Clinton, as he hoped and expected, but to Donald Trump. The Obamas and the Trumps, Donald and Melania, had just spent 45 minutes inside over tea and coffee, a tradition. The public greetings were measured and diplomatically warm – Melania Trump handing over a blue Tiffany gift box under the North Portico. The Obamas seemed like stiffer, more formal versions of their true selves. Within the hour they were off, travelling together to Capitol Hill – the women in one limousine and the men in the car behind. Perhaps conscious that once the Trumps arrived everything would become something of a blur, Obama had used his presidential Twitter account, @POTUS (President of the United States) to communicate some thoughts. “It’s been the honor of my life to serve you,” he wrote just after 9am. “You made me a better leader and a better man.” Then: “I won’t stop; I’ll be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by your voices of truth and justice, good humor and love.” And: “I’m still asking you to believe – not in my ability to bring about change, but in yours. I believe in change because I believe in you.” At 9.14am, Obama was filmed through the glass door of the Oval Office as he completed his final act there, leaving a letter of welcome to his successor, as tradition allows. He shared the space with a man halfway up a step ladder, who appeared to be removing the last traces of the 44th president in time for the imminent arrival of the 45th. Asked if he felt nostalgic, Obama replied: “Of course.” With those two words and his last presidential words immortalised on the web, he was out. Arriving at the Capitol to witness the official passing of power on a mild, cloudy day with dampness in the air, he and Michelle took their places on the West Front of the Capitol. Earlier in the morning, a US Marine Corps helicopter had been spotted on the east side, waiting to take the Obamas away. Obama sat next to the outgoing vice-president, Joe Biden. Michelle Obama sat behind him. Behind her were the Clintons. As President Trump delivered an astonishing, dark, almost dystopian inaugural speech, staggeringly more raw than the norm, Obama attempted to maintain an inscrutable expression. But he appeared grim. However, after Trump wound up his speech and pumped his fists in the air like a prizefighter, Obama shook his hand and clapped him on the arm and could be seen mouthing “good job”. The Obamas followed the Trumps up the carpeted stairs back into the Capitol, each stopping at the top to greet Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican candidate for president, and his wife Elizabeth. Once inside, Obama and Trump strode across the Rotunda together, their wives behind with Vice-President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, and leading Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were among the politicians gathered, alongside military guardsmen on the steps of the East Front of the Capitol as the Obamas and Trumps emerged back into the outdoors. Known as Marine One when a sitting president is aboard, for the immediate-ex president Obama and first lady the waiting helicopter would be known as Executive One. Obama descended the steps shoulder to shoulder with Trump, chatting and sharing a joke. At the bottom, Obama smiled broadly. His wife could not hide an expression akin to melancholy. He lifted her hand to his lips and kissed it, giving her a reassuring smile. Then the Trumps walked the Obamas the few short steps across the rain-soaked paving to the helicopter. Moments after, Biden and his wife Jill got into a limousine to take them to Union station so they could return to Delaware. Barack Obama kissed Melania Trump on the cheek and Donald Trump kissed Michelle Obama, and murmured something in her ear. Then Michelle climbed into the helicopter with Barack Obama behind her. He stopped briefly at the top of the steps to wave twice, smiling, then ducked inside and the door was shut. The Trumps retreated halfway up the steps of the Capitol to stand with the Pences as the helicopter, seconds after 12.45pm, lifted into grey skies and flew towards Joint Base Andrews, where the former president and first lady would be reunited with their daughters, Malia and Sasha. At Andrews, Obama gave a short speech to staff that was in complete contrast to Trump’s gloomy inaugural address. While Trump spoke of inner-city “carnage”, of closed factories and crumbling infrastructure, Obama returned to his abiding theme of hope. “You decided to believe and you knocked on doors and made phone calls,” he said. “You didn’t know how to pronounce Barack Obama, but we got to know each other and throughout it was infused with hope.” As staff members became tearful, he added that he and Michelle had simply been “the front men”. “It’s always been about you,” he said. “All the amazing things that have happened over these last 10 years are really just a testament to you.” The Obamas spent a good 35 minutes saying and hugging their goodbyes. Then they strode across the rain-soaked apron and held hands to walk along a red carpet leading to the steps up into the presidential 747. Familiar the world over as Air Force One, the jet is only called that when a sitting president is aboard. With the Obamas aboard it was simply the presidential plane. They paused to wave and then disappeared inside. The now-former first family have planned a sunshine holiday in Palm Springs, California. No doubt, the golf course will feature. The presidential plane set its nose to the west, with a chance for the Obamas to sit back and relax. No more pre-dawn briefings to come. In a farewell interview on CBS, Obama had said: “Well, here’s one thing is, I’m not setting my alarm. That, I’m certain of. That I am absolutely positive of. I’m going to spend time with Michelle. “And, you know, we got some catching up to do. We’ve both been busy.”"
37,2017-01-20T10:30:05Z,Opinion,Trump's here. We have four years to write a better story,"It’s time to stop playing nice with those who want to destroy us. To win, politicians must offer more radical dreams","Trump is now our president, and no savior will stand between America and its mess. Best case scenario, the most powerful man in the world is a New York Berlusconi. At worst? Picture an elderly, vindictive trust fund brat, surrounded by kleptocrats, racists and pucker-faced spawnlings, his toy box stuffed with spy tools and death machines, the likes of which prior despots could never have imagined. It takes both skill and luck to bake a FailCake as bad as this, and you’ve got to do the prep work for years. Start with a racist celebrity liar. Soak him in media attention. Plunk him into the electoral college, a system engineered to empower slave states at the expense of densely populated cities, then subtract section four of the Voting Rights Act and add in a dash of discriminatory voter ID laws in crucial states. Next, bake upon the ashes of neoliberalism. Shred in Hillary Clinton, victim of misogyny and her husband’s scandals, who also represents everything cowardly, venal and bland about the old order. Smother the whole mess in resentment – some economic woe, some racism, some hatred of women, some deserved loathing for our political class. Sprinkle with “oh fuck it”. Remove on 8 November. Serve lukewarm. In 2016’s hall of corpses, the most loudly mourned might be that of the Liberal Political Consensus. The system served some well, and many more horribly, but it’s murdered, dead, done. In the new world, Hillary Clinton, the realistic, electable candidate, is neither, and institutions meant to keep populists out of power collapse like old soufflés. Like millions of others, reasonable media centrists were blindsided; no wonder they now sound like they’re hitting hallucinogenics. When they’re not playing dress-up as “the resistance”, or blaming Russian-hacked gossip for Clinton’s thin electoral losses, they’re staging grand, last-ditch supplications to electors, the intelligence community, Congress … anyone who might save American democracy from the consequences of its choice. What they don’t realize is there is no going back. Donald Trump may have lost by nearly 3m votes, but this election is a verdict on the status quo. To win, politicians must offer more radical dreams. These can be Trumpian con-jobs, or the humane democratic socialism of Bernie Sanders. In four years, if the Democrats become an actual party for the working class, one that campaigns in all 50 states, fights voter suppression, doesn’t court a mythical White Working Class by kicking the brown, black and queer people who still have its back, if it runs candidates who talk in real words, not Goldman Sachs platitudes, and if it fights Trump till the bloody dawn … maybe it has a shot. To do this, Democrats must learn from their prior sins. The party will be fighting a president they themselves empowered. The Democratic Clinton built mass incarceration, and the Democratic Obama administration championed assassination by drone. The deportations, the torture, the surveillance, the crony capitalism are all part of a system created by Democrats as much as Republicans, all reinforced by adult, bipartisan voices in respectable, badly cut suits. Trump’s promise? Things will get harrowingly, epically worse. Instead of merely rendering Muslims to secret prisons, he’ll do something “a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding” to them beneath a gold Trump marquee. You thought mass surveillance was bad? Wait until he dips into the NSA server farms, then tweets out his critics’ sex tapes. Or cheers on hate crimes before rallies of capped fanboys. Or classes protesters as terrorists. He’ll be yuge. But the man couldn’t do it without the infrastructure bequeathed to him by past administrations. Trump is not a builder. Not of skyscrapers, and not of gulags. He just makes money licensing his name. If you want real resistance, look to the people who fought, and are still fighting, this infrastructure. Indigenous activists. Radical lawyers. Prison solidarity networks. Abortion funds. Churches converted into sanctuary spaces. Anarchists who hold noise demonstrations outside of jails in the freezing January night, so humans inside know they are not forgotten. These groups are even more vital because Trump is not alone. His presidency is the showiest example of a global love affair with fascism; soft rich boy he may be, but he’s a bloated pea in the Duterte, Erdoğan, Putin, Modi pod. In a chaotic world, many people want two things – identity and Daddy. They long for a leader who promises not just to keep them safe, fed and emotionally validated, but to accomplish these things by punishing an imagined Other – the impure, foreign, unreal source of all the homeland’s humiliations. Depending on the country, this Other may be black, Kurdish, Mexican, gay; dancing at a nightclub, doing drugs or wearing a hijab. She may be an impoverished refugee or a decadent urbanite, but she is always looking down her nose at the decent, demagogue-supporting majority. She’s always laughing. Of course, that silent majority doesn’t exist, and neither does that Other. They’re stock figures in an authoritarian’s playbook, substitutes for solutions in our complex, impure, interwoven world. Economic justice is just the first step to beating fascists, orange-colored or otherwise. We need to fight for each other, every last one of us. Not to “tolerate”, like one tolerates painful shoes, but to proudly say that this world belongs to all of us, and that we’re not going anywhere. Ethno-nationalists are escaping from neoliberalism’s cracks, just as they crawled forth from the rot of 19th century empires, singing the same false and bloody tune. On the page, and in the streets, we must write a better story. We have four years."
38,2017-01-20T22:51:35Z,News,Inauguration protests: more than 200 demonstrators arrested in Washington,"Thousands took to the streets of Washington DC for peaceful protests, but pockets of violence saw clashes between police and the president’s dissenters Donald Trump sworn in as 45th president of the United States Inauguration schedule of events: a guide to Trump’s first day","More than 200 protesters were arrested on Friday as police used pepper spray and stun grenades to suppress a series of small, violent confrontations before and after Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. Thousands of protesters from numerous groups descended on Washington DC for mostly peaceful protest throughout inauguration day, in a sign of the dissent and discord Trump’s divisive presidential campaign produced. Shortly after Trump was sworn in, violent protests broke out in the downtown area close to the north lawn of the White House and just blocks from the pathway of the inaugural parade. A few dozen protesters, clad in black, threw projectiles at police and barricaded the road with newspaper kiosks and bins, which they later set fire to. The group were quickly surrounded by police in riot gear who used sting-ball grenades and pepper spray, police said, after a black limousine was set on fire. Before the swearing-in ceremony took place activists from the anarchist group known as the black bloc smashed storefront windows and cars as they clashed with police. Officers in riot gear had again responded with pepper spray and sting-ball grenades, according to police, as the breakaway protesters were overwhelmed with force less than two miles from the US Capitol. The group of about 200 people, many wearing black hoodies and masks, were eventually contained in a police cordon as they chanted: “This is what a police state looks like” and “You’re protecting fascists”. But live-streaming from inside the cordon, known as a police “kettle” revealed that journalists and legal observers were also being held inside. By Friday evening, some members of this first group, had filed a class action lawsuit against the DC metropolitan police department, claiming that they had “suffered physical and emotional injury, as well as loss of liberty” during the episode. Most of the masked protesters declined to be interviewed or named, but one man who refused to give his name said their purpose was to reject “a system of economic exploitation called capitalism”. “It’s not just about no order,” he said. “It’s about human freedom and an economy that’s run by the people.” A spokesman for the DC metropolitan police said law enforcement had arrested 217 people by Friday evening while six officers suffered minor injuries including three officers suffering head traumas after being struck by projectiles. The spokesman also denied that officers had deployed teargas on protesters, despite media reports suggesting otherwise. “We expected this kind of thing from this kind of group, and they’re going to be held accountable,” said Peter Newsham, the interim chief of police, on MSNBC. At a press conference on Friday evening DC mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged the “hundreds and hundreds” of protesters who had “made their voices heard through nonviolent acts of protest”. But added: “Unfortunately a small group of people have engaged in vandalism as well as violence against our law enforcement officers. “This type of destruction and this type of violence against people in Washington DC will not be tolerated.” Another group of activists had attempted earlier to shut down a number of the security points allowing access to the public viewing area of the inauguration on the National Mall on Friday morning. The small groups at these checkpoints, organised by a group named Disrupt J20, linked arms as some members were led away by police wearing body armor. The organization claimed on social media that they had temporarily shut down a number of the dozen checkpoints around the Mall, with a group of Black Lives Matter protesters reportedly closing access at one location for over an hour. Many protesters gained access to the public viewing areas on the Mall, many chanting “not my president” and holding signs with slogans including “Can we impeach him today?” and “Fascist”. Some protesters were also present along the route of the parade later in the day. As the chief justice, John Roberts, rose to administer the oath of office for the incoming president, six protesters, seated on the lawn just in front of the steps to the Capitol, tore off their coats, jumped on to their chairs and began chanting. “A nation united can never be divided,” they said. Together the letters on their shirts spelled: “Resist!” Around them, supporters shouted and called for them to leave. A man shook their chairs until one of the protesters fell. Eventually, security arrived and they were removed from the event. James Ebersole, a protester who had come to Washington from Virginia, said he had decided to come to DC in order to “voice dissent, to say that this is not OK”. “I think it’s unifying people,” he said of the resistance to Trump’s election, while brandishing a sign that read “Misogyny is a danger to society”. “It’s a call to action, a wake-up call, and it unites us against this threat.” Barbara McQueeney had never attended an inauguration before, but she felt compelled to fly out from St Augustine, Florida, to protest outside the barricades lining the National Mall. “I live in an area where there’s a lot of Trump supporters and I’m crushed,” she said. “We need hope.” McQueeney, who is retired, did not engage in much shouting. She instead stood quietly at the center of a protest lifting a homemade poster with the letters USSR spelling out “United States Satellite of Russia”. “Everyone knows they were involved,” she said of Vladimir Putin’s government, “but everyone is just going forward like it’s business as usual.” As the sun began to set and the parade continued into the evening, some activists capped nearly 12 hours on the streets. Ramah Kudaimi, who organized one of the activities associated with Disrupt J20 collective, accused the president of campaigning “on a platform of racism, bigotry and hate”. “We are taking a stand to say that we are against this. Our actions today made that very clear,” said Kudaimi, a board member of the Washington Peace Center, a grassroots organization centered on social justice. Kudaimi oversaw a demonstration that brought together about 100 people to represent those she said had been harassed and threatened by Trump and his supporters – namely Muslims, immigrants and Jewish communities. They were one of the groups who attempted to shut down an entrance checkpoint earlier in the day. In San Francisco protesters took over the pedestrian pathways of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge in an effort to form a “human chain” on Friday afternoon. The action, which did not blocked vehicle traffic, attracted thousands of people, who held hands as part of a peaceful demonstration. At the San Francisco headquarters of Uber, activists shut down the office building, leading to roughly 16 arrests. The tech company’s CEO recently joined Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum. Demonstrators also assembled outside Trump Tower in New York City where seven people, including two New York City councilmen were arrested. The crowd assembled late Friday morning and sat in the road, attempting to stop traffic. Hundreds of protesters also marched later in the evening, arriving at Trump’s 40 Wall Street property in the heart of the city’s financial district. Hundreds of thousands of protesters are expected to descend on Washington for a Women’s March that is scheduled for Saturday, with similar events organized in cities around the country."

Fox announced Farage would be joining to provide political analysis on its main news channel and its business network in a short statement during Trump’s swearing-in as the 45th US president. Fox is owned by Rupert Murdoch, who has attempted to forge ties with Trump following his victory, and was also a backer of the campaign to leave the EU. New York Magazine’s Gabriel Sherman has reported that the media mogul, who owns the Sun and Times newspapers in London, speaks to Trump at least three times a week. Trump has publicly praised Farage, posing with him just after his election victory and tweeting that he would make a “great” ambassador to the US. On Thursday night, Farage and his ally Aaron Banks, who bankrolled the Leave.EU campaign, held a party at a Washington hotel near the White House. During the event, Farage repeatedly praised Trump, describing him as “the only person I have ever met in my life who makes me feel like an introvert” and saying that “Brexit is great, but Trump is Brexit plus plus plus”. Steve Hilton, the former adviser to David Cameron who was also recently unveiled as a Fox contributor, was also at the party organised by Banks and Farage. Trump did not attend despite the organisers repeatedly suggesting he might. It is unclear whether the Fox role will affect Farage’s radio show on LBC, which only began two weeks ago, or his role as MEP for south-east England."
40,2017-01-20T21:00:17Z,News,Women's March organizers prepare for hundreds of thousands of protesters,"With Donald Trump newly installed in the Oval Office, co-chairs herald ‘one of the largest grassroots efforts that anyone has ever seen’","At about 10am on Saturday, as a quarter of a million or more people gather in protest at the base of Capitol Hill for the Women’s March on Washington, the newly minted President Donald Trump will be on his knees at “a service of prayer and reflection” at the National Cathedral. From that perch four miles away from the White House he won’t, initially, be able to hear the civil rights legend Angela Davis, the feminist icon Gloria Steinem or the pro-choice campaigner Cecile Richards addressing the crowds at the march. But the roar of the masses will surely reach the president’s ears later, as the speeches and A-list performers wrap up the three-to-four hour rally and the demonstrators march to the Ellipse, the large green space opposite the White House. He may even see them if he steps out on to the balcony in the residence to admire the view of the Washington Monument. “I hope he will be praying about how to be the president of all the people. We are not going to let our rights be rolled back by anyone,” Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and a speaker at the march, said. The march organizers are still officially only expecting a crowd of 200,000 to 250,000 people – mostly women, but also many men – based on the number who have registered. But those close to the planning acknowledge that they are prepared, in coordination with the police, city officials and thousands of volunteers and private security staff, if the numbers swell considerably, to half a million or beyond. The event is expected to turn into one of the largest marches in US history and although it is not billed specifically as an anti-Trump protest, most of the causes represented are those deemed under threat from the new administration. “I’m speaking out and marching because healthcare is under attack and women’s reproductive rights are under attack. So many awful things were said about women by the incoming president,” said Campbell. “I put a lot of my energy under Obama into supporting black women’s leadership and women’s leadership overall – we could have broken the glass ceiling with Hillary Clinton and it didn’t happen, so that’s what’s motivated me to take part,” she added. Campbell took exception to Trump’s gloomy inaugural speech and his portraiture of inner cities as being in a state of a crime-ridden “American carnage”. “That’s not the urban America I know. Not that there are not problems, but it’s not all rocked with violence and poverty. America is already great, it’s a melting pot and must continue to be,” she said. On Saturday morning, Campbell and other speakers’ voices will boom out from jumbotrons positioned among the thousands packing along Independence Avenue, calling for action on racial equality, climate change, criminal justice reform, a higher minimum wage, immigrants’ rights and a host of other progressive issues. Among those on stage or seated next to the stage in VIP seating will be some of the 60-plus members of Congress from the Democratic party who were set to boycott Trump’s inauguration ceremony on Friday. One of those is US representative Chellie Pingree. While Trump was being sworn in on Friday, she was visiting a Planned Parenthood center and a business owned by immigrants in her home state of Maine, before flying to Washington in the afternoon to get ready for the march. On Saturday morning, she will gather with fellow politicians on stage at the rally and then march with some of the 5,000 women attending from the state of Maine. “We need to do everything we can to let the incoming administration know we are not happy about their agenda. I’ve had unprecedented numbers of my constituents calling me worried about healthcare, the environment, public education, and they feel disrespected,” she said. Pingree said Trump was the most unpredictable incoming president most people had ever witnessed. While Trump struggled to get A-list names to perform at his inauguration celebrations, the Women’s March on Washington has attracted singing and acting stars such as Katy Perry; America Ferrera, who is also speaking at the rally; the Orange is the New Black cast member Uzo Aduba; the actor Scarlett Johansson; Cher and the young actor and singer Zendaya. The march grew organically, from a feminist outcry on Facebook in the immediate aftershock of the election result. Organizers now hope it will kickstart a new era of grassroots activism across a long list of progressive issues chiefly related to equality and social and economic justice. What began as an expression of frustration and a call to action on social media then morphed into a mass mobilization across multiple progressive causes. The event began to be physically realized on Friday as buses, trains and planes started pouring into Washington, packed full of women – and supportive male friends dotted among them. Although so-called sister marches are taking place in as many as 300 cities across all 50 states, as well as internationally, thousands chose the capital city to make their presence felt next to the Capitol and the White House. “This is what a plane full of women who are ready to resist the Trump agenda looks like,” read one tweet, showing a flight bound for DC packed with women smiling and waving ecstatically, some wearing pink knit “pussy hats” that have become an informal uniform for the march. “I am a woman of color and a Muslim from an immigrant family whose country is now going to be led by someone who has been openly anti-immigrant and sexist, has attacked Muslims and is surrounding himself with some horrible people for his cabinet,” said Zahra Billoo, director of the San Francisco chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and a speaker at the march. “I don’t think that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is racist, but they were willing to overlook that part of his campaign for whatever reason, and that’s not acceptable. We’ve seen the fallout, in hate crimes, and there is a need for inspiration and community across racial lines, religious lines, family lines, across many communities in America right now,” she said. Billoo said she found Trump’s inaugural speech “no better than so many of his campaign speeches”. She saw in it coded language designed to further divide rather than unite voters and to erase civil liberties, she said. “All of this ‘America first’ is one way of saying if you don’t agree with us, we will come after you,” she said. Following scuffles and arrests in protests coinciding with the inauguration on Friday, Billoo said she hoped the Women’s March on Washington itself would be a wholly peaceful rally and demonstration. The march is due to finish at dusk. But Linda Sarsour, one of the four march co-chairs, hopes that the end of the event will mark the beginning of a new movement. “Making the march happen has been one of the largest grassroots efforts that anyone has ever seen. This is a mass mobilization and we intend to hold the administration to account,” she said."
41,2017-01-20T15:05:35Z,News,New president's fans gather on National Mall for 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity',"Red hats abound in Washington ahead of president-elect’s swearing-in, but some supporters voice doubts: ‘I’ll hold him to account’","A steady flow of red trucker hats snaked to checkpoints around the US Capitol and the National Mall on Friday morning to mark the transfer of power from Barack Obama to Donald Trump. “I never thought I’d be here in the first place, but to be here for the election of Donald Trump, it’s incredible,” Ann Marie Sinisi, who came to Washington DC with her family for the inauguration from Queens, New York, the borough where the president-elect was born. Sinisi has been familiar with Trump since he was a young businessman bragging about his prowess to local tabloids. She is doubtful the presidency will change Trump, and that’s exactly why she voted for him. “He is who he is,” she said, adding: “A lot of people think he’s a bad businessman because of all the bankruptcies. That’s not always a bad thing – I’m a bankruptcy lawyer!” Her daughter, Dawn Marie Sinisi Feiler, said Trump’s biggest task ahead would be uniting the country, which has been rocked by protests since his election. “I really believe he’s already made changes – like the factory jobs,” Sinisi Feiler said, referring to public pressure Trump had put on companies to keep American jobs in the country, with debatable effectiveness. “If he keeps doing that, if he does so much good that it’s undeniable, he will unite the country.” Isaac Deal travelled by bus to the inauguration from Indianapolis with his classmates. “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Deal said, wearing a camouflage Make America Great Again hat. At 19, his first vote cast for president was for Trump. Deal said he liked Trump’s anti-establishment message, his railing against money in politics and crony capitalism, but he said he had been dismayed by Trump’s cabinet picks, which include a number of billionaires with Wall Street ties. “Donald Trump promised to drain the swamp and with his cabinet picks he’s picking the very same trolls who run the swamp,” he said, adding that he was willing to give Trump more time to build his team. “I voted for him because I thought he was the best man for the job, but I’m not a Trump fanboy. I’ll hold him to account,” Deal said. Anthony Juiffrey, of New York, said he had voted for Trump because of his economic agenda and promise to create more jobs in America. He said he understands the protesters – and might have been one himself had Trump lost - but said the charges against Trump’s supporters were not fair. “I’ve heard all the ‘ists’ – racist, chauvinist, you name it,” Juiffrey said. “That’s not true … If Trump came out with some kind of serious plan, government-sponsored racism, where he said let’s throw out all the Mexicans or something like that, I’d be really upset and I’d fight that. But so far that’s not what he’s saying.” Ronald Celony, a Trump voter, had flown in from Miami, Florida, to take in the day’s festivities. “I cannot see it on TV – I have to see it live,” he said, before gesturing to his surroundings. Celony, who immigrated from Haiti more than two decades ago, said he was confident Trump would “bring jobs back to America”. “People can say whatever they want about Trump, but he knows exactly what he’s doing,” he said. “When you see what he’s accomplished in his life, if he puts the same ideas in office, he’s going to make America great again. There’s no doubt about it.” Stella Slattery, a resident of upstate New York, dubbed it “a historic day” as she made her way toward the Capitol in a white Trump-Pence T-shirt. She, too, pointed to Trump’s vast business empire as evidence of his promise. “Donald Trump is a proven businessman,” Slattery said, “and it’s about time that America be run like a corporation and not like a free-for-all for a few politicians and well-to-do.” Asked about her hopes for Trump’s presidency, she offered a simple thought: “To bring America to what it used to be.” Many of those who descended upon Washington to support the president-elect expressed similar sentiments, echoing Trump’s rhetoric on the campaign trail. He would be a champion of the working class, they insisted, and perhaps most importantly would serve as a symbol against the politics that have long ruled the nation’s capital. “Both the Republican and Democratic establishment has let America down,” said John D, a Trump supporter who requested not to provide his full name. “Even though Donald Trump isn’t a politician and we don’t know what we’re going to get out of him, at least it’s going to be different,” he said. Hailing from Michigan, one of the battleground states where Trump’s victory was most unexpected, John D said he expected better trade policies from Trump and a closure of US borders. But he acknowledged there was a level of risk associated with the incoming president. “It may be good or it may be bad, but it’s a change worth taking.” There were some hangovers from the anger-fuelled campaign that lifted Trump to victory in November. A man in a cowboy hat posed for a photo with a shirt that said “Hillary for Prison 2016”. Asked whether he was disappointed Trump backed off his pledge to jail his political opponent if elected, the man waved away the question. “Today’s a good day,” he said, walking away without giving his name. “I’m thrilled to be here.”"
42,2017-01-20T05:00:00Z,News,Welcome to a new era of  politically sanctioned patriarchy,The parallels between misogyny in the US and Egypt are stark – we must respond by recognising the common enemy,"Today, I will force myself to watch the inauguration of Donald Trump because I want to stay angry. The sight of a sexual predator taking the oath to become the president of the most powerful country on earth will keep my pilot light of rage burning bright. I take pride in that anger. As I do my declaration of faith: “Fuck the Patriarchy”. As an Egyptian-American feminist, my cup of patriarchy overfloweth. The first foreign leader to call and congratulate Trump upon his election victory in November was the Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Of course! I could not imagine two world leaders whose public record of misogyny better capture the politically sanctioned patriarchy that so challenges feminism today. One, Trump, has openly boasted that his fame allowed him to “grab women by the pussy”. At least 24 women have accused the next US president of inappropriate sexual behaviour in multiple incidents spanning the last 30 years. The other, Sisi, was the head of military intelligence in March 2011 when 17 female activists detained at protests were subjected to “virginity tests” by the military. The women were vaginally examined against their will by military doctors. Sisi justified the tests at the time, saying they were to protect the military against accusations of rape – as if only virgins could technically be raped. When the leader of a country is so misogynist, so abusive and cavalier with regards to women’s bodies, it sends a green light that women’s bodies are fair game, not worthy of respect. Some, especially on the right wing in the US, like to tell American women to consider the sorry plight of women in Egypt, for example. Look how bad it is over there, they say, in order to make women grateful that they live in the US. Such myopic misogyny, in essence, is telling women to shut up, accept their lot and be grateful they have it so good. Some, especially among those who deny misogyny in Egypt, like to tell Egyptian women to consider the reality of women’s lives in the US, for example. They still have not elected a woman as president, they say, to make them realise that the US isn’t that much better than Egypt. Such denial of misogyny in essence is telling women to shut up and accept their lot because it’s shit everywhere. Then Trump happened. And before him, Sisi happened. And as 2014 election results from Egypt and 2016 results from the US reminded us, they happened with the help of a lot of women who voted for those two Misogynists in Chief. Gratitude and acceptance be damned! When I heard that 53% of white American women voters cast their ballot for Trump I was enraged. But the Egyptian and Muslim in me also had a moment not so much of schadenfreude – Trump will hurt us all, not just white women who voted against their own interests – as much as a burning sense of hypocrisy. As that Egyptian, Muslim woman I have been on the receiving end of countless questions about why Muslim women accept x or y and z. Now the same questions can be asked of those voters. Belonging to a faith is slightly different than voting in an election. But you can make an argument that a vote in a free and fair election such as that for US president is equally a clear, if not more direct, expression of one’s principles. I’ve become obsessed with those white women voters who showed up at Trump rallies with “Talk Dirty to Me”, “Adorable Deplorables” and “Grab This Pussy” T-shirts; the women who said that if men don’t use Trump’s awful language about women’s bodies there was something wrong with them; the women who dismissed as liars all the women who accused Trump of assaulting them. Those white women Trump voters allowed their race to trump their gender. They were a reminder that decades of Republican racist policies mixed with increasing Christian fundamentalism and bigotry had succeeded in turning women against their own interests. Those women think they will be protected from Republican patriarchy by allying themselves with it but nothing protects women from patriarchy. In Egypt, I have been obsessed with the women who voted for Sisi: the women who danced at polling stations; who gushed over Sisi as if he were a sensitive beloved whereas he was head of military intelligence during the 25 January 2011 revolution responsible for untold violence. Much like the adoring women at Trump campaign rallies, adulating women at a Sisi conference shortly before his electoral victory in 2014 flocked around him as if he were a teen pop star. Those women voted for Sisi and intentionally forgot that he justified sexual assaults in the form of “virginity tests” because they accepted Sisi’s narrative that he had “saved” them and Egypt from the Muslim Brotherhood. But Sisi just ensured the survival of military rule. Nothing protects women from the patriarchy of military regimes. The roles of Egyptian women in the military are limited to being nurses and administrators. Sisi often talks about women as mothers and wives. He is a conservative, devout man who has overseen a moral crusade against LGBTQ Egyptians. He is no feminist. The religious fundamentalists of the Republican party are a mirror image of the religious fundamentalists of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood. I like to call the Republicans the Christian Brotherhood of the US so that my fellow Americans recognise the line that connects their mix of religion and politics with their Muslim equivalent in Egypt. Both the Christian Brotherhood of the US and Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood are obsessed with women’s bodies – specifically our vaginas. As I like to tell them both: stay out of my vagina unless I want you in there. Examine the record of Trump’s vice president Mike Pence – a Christian fundamentalist who governed Indiana with a mix of misogyny and homophobia while engaged in war with women’s reproductive rights. Another horrifying parallel between Trump and Sisi is their authoritarianism. Trump has appointed the highest number of generals of any US president. Authoritarianism, religious fundamentalism and militarism are inherently patriarchal and hierarchical. You can guess where in that hierarchy women stand. Challenging this hierarchy is 2017’s crusade. The war will be waged most effectively by recognising the global sisterhood of the oppressed and knowing that our battles are local. That is how we will defeat this era of politically sanctioned patriarchy. Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians. Follow @GuardianGDP on Twitter.

43,2017-01-20T19:00:33Z,News,"Fact-checking the inaugural speech: the economy, crime and hiring American","In his first presidential speech, Donald Trump painted a bleak picture on issues ranging from education to the military. Alan Yuhas sorts fact from fiction‘American carnage’: Trump’s vision casts shadow over day of pageantryThe full text of Donald Trump’s inauguration speech","“For too long a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government … Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth.” This is technically true – the Washington DC area has seen more than a decade of growth – but more complicated as a rhetorical attack on Washington as a symbol of “the establishment”. The chasm of American inequality has a long history with origins spread around the country. Since 2000, the wealthiest 10% Americans have “reaped” the vast majority of the economy’s rewards. Many of those richest Americans are concentrated on the coasts, but most Americans, regardless of their geography or politics, only saw their income increase in 2015, after years of stagnation. That said, the middle class has been diminishing for years, according to a 2015 Pew study, as the population has shifted more into two other categories: upper income and lower. The actual geography is uneven: some research shows that the most unequal states in 2010 were California and New York, and that states like North Dakota and Montana saw booms and busts alongside the gas industry. Trump has a more literal point, too – the average member of Congress is far wealthier than the average American – but the leaders of Washington DC are hardly uniform in their attitude toward inequality. For instance, Trump’s cabinet (if his nominees are all confirmed) is set to be the wealthiest in history and will include a former banker who profited immensely on foreclosing homes during the 2008 financial crisis, a billionaire called a “vulture” investor because of his history of picking apart businesses, and two other advisers, Steven Bannon and Gary Cohn, who are former Goldman Sachs executives. “Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed.” American manufacturing has been in decline for decades for a host of reasons. During the campaign, Trump liked to blame free trade deals such as Nafta, but outsourced jobs are only part of the equation. In 2015, the Congressional Research Service wrote: “Nafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.” The deal’s net effect “appears to have been relatively modest”, the researchers concluded. Three years earlier, the OECD found that manufacturing jobs fled the US after the deal was signed but also noted the broader shift toward a service economy. Meanwhile, China has become the world’s largest manufacturer by dint of its beneficial trade status, its human and material resources, its lax and dangerous labor laws, and the steroidal advance of automation, which continues to destroy and create jobs in the US as well. Politicians played a part in all of this, but over multiple generations. “An education system flushed with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.” The US education system, like its economy, is riven by gigantic inequities that vary by state. In 2015-16, public school teachers around the US earned, on average, between $42,025 and $77,957, according to the National Education Association, which would make them squarely in the middle class or on its edges, depending on where they live. Teachers are paid best in New York, Washington DC and Massachusetts, and paid least in South Dakota, Mississippi and Idaho. School districts, on the other hand, differ greatly from each other, and experts have spent decades debating the best ways to shape education. Trump’s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, has no experience in the public school system and instead has, in her home state of Michigan, campaigned to move students into private charter schools and into voucher programs. Charter schools have spread across Michigan, but the state’s academic performance has slid behind that of other states, and charter schools she has championed are now much derided. “The crime and the gangs and the drugs.” Trump is conjuring up a vision of America as a wasteland that does not square with reality. The nationwide crime rate remains low, about half what it was in 1991, despite a 4% increase in violent crime in 2015. That single-year increase was largely due to major increases in a few cities – namely Baltimore, Washington DC and Chicago – even as the US’s largest cities, including New York and Los Angeles, held crime to historic lows. Murders of black men and murders by firearms accounted for most of the increase. During his campaign, Trump often falsely lumped “gangs” in with undocumented migrants; there is no evidence to suggest that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes than US-born citizens, and undocumented migration has not increased for about five years. Trump is correct that the US has a drug problem: a surgeon general’s report last year found that one in seven people in the US will probably develop a substance-abuse problem, and only one in 10 will receive treatment. Trump has talked about wanting to treat addiction as a health problem, but his pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has a record of supporting criminalization in line with the “war on drugs”. “For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. We defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own.” Trump is right that corporations, foreign and domestic, have profited enormously in the last decade. He is less correct about national security. The US has budgeted $4.5bn for border security in 2017, an increase from 2016 and in line with Barack Obama’s general expansion of the Border Patrol and homeland security spending. After the so-called sequestration cuts of 2013, a result of a fight between the White House and Congress over taxes, the Pentagon was forced to reduce its budget by 7.7%. The defense department’s leaders have rejected the idea that the military is “depleted”, however, and the Obama administration has worked to replace ageing equipment and develop new weapons. “And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.” A 2013 study estimated that the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have cost Americans between $4tn and $6tn. Foreign aid, on the other hand, costs on average about $31-$40bn a year, or about 1% of the total US federal budget of $3.5tn. The proposed 2017 budget for foreign aid is $50.1bn. “We will follow two simple rules – buy American and hire American.” Trump has yet to follow his own rule: his Mar-a-Lago club in south Florida has continued to hire foreign workers even after he won the White House."
44,2017-01-20T18:47:01Z,News,Senators delay 'rushed' confirmation vote for president's pick to run CIA,"Dissatisfied by Mike Pompeo’s answers on surveillance issues, Democrats said job was too important to be subject of ‘rubber stamp’ hearing on inauguration dayDonald Trump sworn in as 45th president – live coverage","Senate Democrats have delayed the confirmation of Donald Trump’s nominee to run the CIA, saying that job was too important to be the subject of a “rubber stamp” hearing on the day of the presidential inauguration. In the first skirmish between congressional Democrats and the White House over national security of the Trump era, senators Ron Wyden, Patrick Leahy and Richard Blumenthal said that they opposed a “rushed” confirmation for Mike Pompeo that Republicans had bundled with two other security-related nominees. Wyden, Leahy and Blumenthal said that no CIA director had ever been confirmed on the day of a presidential inauguration, adding in a statement: “The importance of the position of CIA Director, especially in these dangerous times, demands that the nomination be thoroughly vetted, questioned and debated.” The senators said: “Our constituents expect Congress to be a check and balance on the incoming administration, not a rubber stamp.” Wyden was dissatisfied by answers Pompeo provided to the committee on two major surveillance questions: Pompeo’s Wall Street Journal op-ed arguing for the “collection of all metadata” to be assembled into “a comprehensive, searchable database”; and on the propriety of the CIA receiving information on Americans collected by foreign powers. The Senate intelligence committee had been due to vote on Pompeo’s confirmation on Friday alongside that of retired marine generals James Mattis, tasked to run the Pentagon, and John Kelly, tapped to run the Department of Homeland Security. According to an aide, Wyden is stopping short of blocking Pompeo’s nomination outright. Instead, Wyden aims to delay the vote until after the weekend to provide the Senate an extended period to debate Pompeo. The votes on Mattis and Kelly will not be affected by the delayed vote on Pompeo, and both are expected to receive confirmation from the Senate. Pompeo, a Kansas Republican congressman set to run an agency with which Trump has openly feuded, sought during his confirmation hearing last week to smooth over his more controversial proposals. In written responses to Wyden, Pompeo backed away from his proposed hoard of metadata, repeatedly saying, “My op-ed was designed to provide general thoughts on the types of information that may be helpful in protecting the country. I did not propose a full legislative framework that would govern exact access to such information, the restrictions on searches and dissemination, or retention time frames.” Additionally, Pompeo appeared to give a contradictory answer about the propriety of a foreign government providing the CIA with communications concerning Americans against whom there were no warrants. Pompeo told Wyden at the hearing: “The same set of rules that surround the information if it were collected by the US government apply to information that becomes available as – as a result of collection from non-US sources, as well.” But in correspondence with the committee, Pompeo wrote that it was “appropriate” for the CIA to receive such intelligence on Americans “without the same requirements that would apply if the CIA itself were to collect the information”. Pompeo also repeatedly pledged to follow laws currently banning torture and bulk domestic phone records collection. But some Democrats worry that a justice department under Trump’s attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, would provide legal reinterpretations to reconcile both practices within current statutory prohibitions, similar to its behavior during the Bush administration."
45,2017-01-20T15:21:20Z,News,New US administration unlikely to be awed by China's year-end spurt,GDP growth improved to 6.8% but only after a 19% increase in public investment and a lighter touch on real estate borrowing,"The silver lining in China’s disappointing 2016 growth figures was the pickup in performance at the end of the year. Or so it seems. Annualised GDP growth improved to hit 6.8% in the final three months of 2016, compared with the previous quarter’s 6.7%, in a show of strength that a wary Donald Trump will see as further evidence of Beijing’s trading prowess. It is unlikely, however, that the new White House administration will miss the startling fact that it took a 19% increase in public investment and a lighter touch on real estate borrowing to reverse, if only for one quarter, the fortunes of the world’s second largest economy. Without an injection of government funds and higher borrowing by construction companies and developers, both of which Trump plans to emulate, China’s growth would likely have been outside the 6.5% to 7% target range it set itself. As it was, an assessment of 2016 found that its full-year performance was still the weakest in nearly three decades. Beijing and the US are on different paths though. It is widely thought that a Trump stimulus will overload an economy already running at full capacity - think of the obese diner eating a wafer thin mint in Monty Python’s Meaning of Life - while Beijing is managing a long decline in growth as it attempts to wean itself off the diminishing returns from export-led growth. Alarm bells ring when the slowdown is too strong and unemployment begins to grow. President Xi Jinping has reacted to this by switching on the public sector spending taps. Analysts said house prices also surged, but regulators are taking steps to cool the market, which will depress this year’s performance. Diana Choyleva, the chief economist at Enodo Economics, said: “China cannot adjust to a more sustainable system without pain. Reforms will be deflationary and cannot happen with an overvalued currency.” She expects a 10% devaluation in the yuan this year if Beijing reins in lending. A devaluation might go unnoticed in Washington for a while, but with Trump threatening to slap tariffs on Chinese goods if the dollar strengthens against the yuan, it could spark a disastrous trade war."

47,2017-01-20T14:14:38Z,News,Davos 2017: what we learned at the WEF,"Banks got a warm welcome, Britain got a cool reception and climate change fears abounded at the World Economic Forum","They’re terrified of Trump Donald Trump has been on everyone’s mind, even though he has been on the other side of the Atlantic this week preparing for his inauguration. Most criticism of the incoming US president was firmly off the record, showing that no one wants to be caught in the firing line of @realdonaldtrump’s Twitter feed. One insider said some US executives are nervous of being seen posing with Chinese leaders, in case the Oval Office saw this as unpatriotic. Banks are off the hook Banks, particularly those stationed in the City of London, have been the unexpected beneficiaries of the new mood of populism sweeping the west. Having been treated as pariahs for causing the global financial crisis, banks are now wooed by all and sundry. The UK government is keen to reassure Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and the other Wall Street names that they’ll still be able to operate in the London, while European leaders see the opportunity to steal jobs. Banks are fully aware they’re no longer on the naughty step, and have been dropping hints that they’ll leave London if they don’t get the deal they want. Predictions are out, unless you’re Soros Sir Martin Sorrell, the boss of advertising giant WPP, said he was out of the forecasting game after confidently predicting at last year’s Davos that Hillary Clinton would be US president and Brexit would never happen. This year, the chastened Mystic Megs of Davos were reluctant to put their credentials on the line by calling the French presidential election, for example. But George Soros – still making headines at 86 – retains the nerve to predict that markets will soon fall, Theresa May won’t last long, and that US checks and balances will stop Trump being a dictator. We wouldn’t put much money on another Soros idea – that Britain might quit the EU on a Friday and rejoin on a Monday. Britain gets a cool reception Theresa May and Philip Hammond had the unenviable task of explaining to the overwhelmingly pro-remain crowd at Davos what the government was up to now that the decision had gone the other way. Perhaps understandably, May’s reception was cool rather than rapturous – even though she sought to reassure her audience that her vision was a global Britain rather than a siege economy. Hammond didn’t help the mood by repeatedly hinting that Britain could slash taxes and burn regulations if it doesn’t get what it wants. Martin Wolf of the FT got a laugh by calling this the “Singapore-on-Thames” option – but Europe doesn’t get the joke. Yesterday’s men flock to Davos Enoch Powell was wrong when he said every political career ends in failure. For some washed-up politicians, it ends in Davos. George Osborne, a WEF darling only 12 months ago, has gone from debating the global economy with Christine Lagarde to posing with the Clooneys at a swanky drinks reception. Davos’s nightlife is a great chance to relive Oxford student days, and Osborne was seen enjoying a scotch at PR magnate Matthew Freud’s bash at a private chalet at the Schatzalp hotel, only reachable by funicular railway. Other one-time political heavyweights who couldn’t keep away included David Cameron, widely criticised this week for holding the EU referendum, Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson. Climate change fears abound Campaigners are worried that the years of slow progress made on climate change are going to melt away once Trump is in the White House. Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg spoke for many when she warned that Trump might simply not implement the Paris agreement, to keep global warming “well below” 2C. Activists at Davos told us they were keeping a very close eye on the Trump administration, fearing it will alter or make unavailable vital climate change data. China is flexing its muscles At Davos you know a speaker is a real draw if they manage to fill both the cavernous conference hall and also the overspill room. That was the case for Chinese president Xi Jinping’s opening address, seen as an attempt by Beijing to seize the mantle of cheerleader for globalisation from Washington. The word on the floor is that China isn’t ready to dislodge the US – and might not win a trade war either. But it was dominating Davos, with Alibaba’s Jack Ma signing a massive Olympic sponsorship deal and chiding America for wasting money on its military rather than spending it on infrastructure. One spin-off for the local economy was that Xi’s 200-strong delegation required 100 drivers, which usually cost 10,000 Swiss francs for a week. Is Sadiq the new Boris? Sadiq Khan packed a lot into just 20 hours at Davos this year. When he wasn’t telling bank chiefs and politicians that London is open for business, he was racing from TV camera to microphone to liveblog to warn that a hard Brexit would rip Britain apart. Labour hasn’t had a lot to cheer about recently, but winning the mayoralty was one bright spot. Judging by UK businesses’ reaction to Khan this week, London chose the right man to fight its corner through the Brexit negotiations. He wouldn’t be the first politician to use City Hall – and Davos – as a stepping stone for bigger things."
48,2017-01-20T10:30:05Z,Opinion,Why my seat at the inauguration is empty,"I will not be celebrating the swearing-in of a president who rode racism, sexism, xenophobia and bigotry to the White House","The peaceful transition of power is a hallmark of American democracy – a foundational principle that I honor and respect. On Friday, Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States. The crowning moment of an American presidency is the inauguration: a special occasion designed in many ways to celebrate the incoming administration. I will not be celebrating the swearing-in of a president who rode racism, sexism, xenophobia and bigotry to the White House. Instead of attending the inauguration, I will be planning and organizing for resistance. President-elect Trump ran one of the most divisive and prejudiced campaigns in modern history. He began his campaign by insulting Mexican immigrants, pledging to build a wall between the United States and Mexico and then spent a year and a half denigrating communities of color and normalizing bigotry. He denigrated women, stoked Islamophobia and attacked a Gold Star family. He mocked a disabled reporter and appealed to people’s worst instincts. After the election, I hoped the president-elect would turn toward unifying our country. After all, he said it was “time for us to come together”. Despite my unwavering reservations about his candidacy and fitness for office, I encouraged my constituents to have faith that our constitution, our democracy and the voices of the American people would prevail. Sadly, the president-elect has done nothing of the sort; he has instead shown us that he will utilize the same tools of division he employed on the campaign trail as our nation’s commander-in-chief. President-elect Trump has named Steve Bannon his chief strategist, a man who proudly gave the “alt-right” and white nationalism a platform in his leadership role at Breitbart. He has nominated Senator Jeff Sessions to the office of attorney general, despite his long career of opposition to civil and human rights. To make matters worse, after the intelligence community reported Russian interference in our election, the president-elect frequently and forcefully defended Vladimir Putin. He insulted senior intelligence officials in order to preserve his reputation and disguise the truth. Last week it became clearer than ever before that the president-elect is not concerned about being presidential. On the eve of Dr Martin Luther King Jr’s memorial weekend he took to Twitter to insult the legendary civil rights icon Congressman John Lewis, tweeting that he was “all talk and no action”. Congressman John Lewis nearly gave his life in the fight for civil rights and human rights. He was instrumental in the passage of the Voting Rights Act and he has spent decades in Congress fighting on behalf of his constituents. He should be applauded for speaking out, not criticized. The president-elect has continuously shown that he will govern as he campaigned with no regard for consequence. Dr Martin Luther King Jr once said: “A time comes when silence is betrayal.” Now is not the time for us to be silent. We must join together and refuse to allow this vision for our country to go unchallenged. We must resist. I hope my empty seat at the inauguration sends a message to my constituents and millions across the country that they have allies in Congress who will resist the agenda that targets the most vulnerable and marginalized, rolls back civil rights and prioritizes millionaires and billionaires over everyday Americans. And that no matter the opposition, we are prepared to defend our nation and its fundamental values on day one of the Trump presidency."

50,2017-01-20T09:00:28Z,News,Too much love: Nigel Farage and friends have a bad boys' ball in DC,"In a hotel overlooking the White House, revellers wondered if the other half of the ‘beautiful friendship’ would arrive","On the top floor of a very grand hotel overlooking the White House, the Mississippi governor, Phil Bryant, is introducing the guest of honour to an enraptured throng of party guests. He has fondest memories of August, when Nigel Farage told a crowd of 10,000 Mississippians all about Brexit. “They were fired up,” Phil explained. “They were drinking the Kool-Aid, and they were licking the jar.” Not sure Phil fully gets the Kool-Aid thing. Still, please welcome Nigel Farage and his entourage (hereafter the enfarage). “We got the bad boys of Brexit here!” hollers Phil. The aforementioned bad boys comprise Farage, Arron Banks, the insurance millionaire who funded Leave.EU’s campaign, and Arron’s communications chief, Andy Wigmore (though they seem to have let a grateful-looking Lord Ashcroft be one for the night). During the EU referendum period, your correspondent once referred to them in passing as “the provisional wing of the leave campaign”, a designation they liked so much they began including it on press releases. Good to see a Washington party in aid of a provisional wing again. You don’t get as many of those to the pound as you used to. At this one, everybody’s drinking liberal tears daiquiris and explaining how the right “haven’t caught a break in America since Reagan”, except for the man giving me an unsolicited history lesson. “Abraham Lincoln,” he is saying, “who was a guy who was our president a long long time ago” – “Hang on. Let me just write his name down so I don’t forget it. How are you spelling Lincoln?” Later, a woman looks darkly over at the White House. “The one thing I am so happy about,” she hisses, “is that this is THEIR last night in there.” Overall party vibe? The West Wing for people who think you could have got an episode over a lot quicker if you just stopped the endless yakking and bombed Haiti / called the Danish president a fat bitch / started a land war in Asia. But we already knew that smirking in front of a gold door is the new talking while walking in corridors. I wouldn’t like to hazard precisely what percentage of the guests the hosts had ever clapped eyes on before tonight. But the event may well be the equivalent of the guy who shows up to his school reunion in a chauffeur-driven Bentley (hired) with two girlfriends (also hired). “Have you ever seen so many people gathered in one place in order to be rich, powerful and disgusting together?” wondered Don DeLillo in the fictionalised account of Truman Capote’s Black and White Ball that appeared in his novel Underworld. The week before this Washington gathering, I sent Banks a long account of the Black and White Ball. Having read it, he pronounced: “That is exactly what our party’s going to be like.” That’s not all he said. In fact, the last time I heard this much about the minutiae of a coming soiree I was reading Mrs Dalloway. Of course, there is the odd departure from the novel. Unlike Clarissa Dalloway, whose to-do list doesn’t involve a whole lot more than buying flowers, the enfarage prepared for the evening with a round of media appearances. They’re so keen to complete the Washington platform game that they even fitted in a trip to lay a wreath at the national war cemetery in Arlington, having discovered that a single Briton was helpful enough to have been buried there. There were also conversations with movie people to discuss optioning Banks’s book – The Bad Boys of Brexit – for development as a motion picture. The enfarage tell me they’re in negotiations to get the House of Cards writer Michael Dobbs to do the script. “He should be here somewhere,” says Andy. Maybe he’s in the loo with the incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn – also said to be “around somewhere”. Guest list-wise, then, I’d say Capote just about had the edge, even if he did break off from conversation with Greta Garbo to beg Sinatra not to leave in the small hours. The enfarage wanted the Trump strategist Steve Bannon; they got the Cameron strategist Steve Hilton. When you’ve decided the way to matter is to be near to people who matter … well, I guess it matters if you can only muster the rank-and-file of the DC arseoisie. This week in Washington, the success of a party is measured in how much power is concentrated in its attendees. Naturally, everyone wants the big one. Every host is essentially throwing an extravagant party for dreadful people in the desperate hope that a certain someone will come. Think of it all as The Great Twatsby. “Is Donald coming?” asks a miniskirted judge who has a show on Fox News. “Don’t know,” says Andy, though I think we do. At different points during the evening, various men are presumed to be secret service operatives covertly sweeping the room, but Trump’s failure to materialise – either via the door or through a haunted mirror – suggests they were actually just guests with shifty eyes and really thick necks. Thus it was up to Nigel – who can only be days off a mid-Atlantic accent – to provide the box office. “Donald Trump,” he told the room, “is the only person I have ever met in my life who makes me feel like an introvert.” What about Russell Brand on Question Time, when he called you a pound shop Enoch Powell? But of course, no one here saw that show. And in case the party guests had heard any other fake news folklore about the teetotal president-elect’s best lapdog, Nigel would like to set them straight. In the years before Brexit, he didn’t “spend several hours a day drowning my sorrows with English beer – though if you read the British press that’s what you think I did”. Of course, there is a rich tradition of Brits relishing the chance to lose their baggage on an Atlantic crossing. Not their luggage, you understand, but of all the bits of their backstory that they’d like to consign to oblivion. When David Beckham went to play for LA Galaxy, his wife, Victoria, basically got on the plane with Wag hair extensions, and got off it a sophisticated fashion designer. And so with Farage, who is no longer the man who failed to get elected to parliament seven times – and certainly not the wobbler who conceded no less than twice on referendum night itself. He isn’t the guy who the official leave campaign believe not only failed to persuade anyone who wasn’t already going to vote for them, but actively put off those who might otherwise have done so. We lost contact with that guy somewhere over the Bermuda Triangle. Nigel is now Mr Brexit. He is all dressed up and doing Washington. Indeed, there was much to enjoy in guest explanations for why Farage had just mingled off out of their conversational orbit. “I think what it is,” declares one man, “is that he gets so much love – so much love – that sometimes he just needs to take a moment.” Mm. He took a moment fairly swiftly after one couple presented him with a highly covetable piece of man jewellery: a chunky Donald Trump ring. In the end, the point of the party seemed to be to remind everyone that this is a love story. “Y’all have something called a blind date in the UK?” Governor Bryant asked me. “You know a blind date, where you set up two beautiful people? Well I had these two guys – the two guys in the western world who most needed to meet each other. I had Nigel, who was Mr Brexit. And I had this tremendous hero, who was going to be the president of the United States. And I had to get them together. It was the start of a beautiful friendship.” A friendship, anyway. What feels a little poignant is Nigel’s willingness these days to make Brexit a wholly owned subsidiary of Trump. “I agree with Trump,” he said in one of several variations on a theme. “Brexit is great, but Trump is Brexit plus plus plus.” Where Nigel goes, others follow. Bryant says he turned to his wife as the Brexit result came through, and said: “That was Trump’s first victory.” Well done, Donald. No doubt he’d have liked to be here tonight. Certainly, he’d have recognised the self-dramatisation that underpins all these sort of parties. Made it ma! Top o’ the world! Or at least, top of a hotel really very near the White House. I don’t want to get all Seven Ages of Parties here, but there seems to be a point where you graduate from wanting the hot girls or boys to come to your parties and start wanting the funny girls and boys to come. Then eventually, some people start wanting a four-star general they’ve never met to show up. I wonder if the regular attendees of these things truly love them, or if the memory of genuine fun occasionally twitches like a phantom limb?"
51,2017-01-20T07:49:15Z,News,Social workers can help cure ailing democracies,Social services and welfare systems offer ways of restoring missing links in politics: community cohesion and solidarity,"Donald Trump’s inauguration as president will deepen the concern he has already caused among vulnerable communities in the US and globally. The commitments he made during his campaign for the White House – rolling back state health and social care, undermining the human rights of refugees and immigrants, and escalating global tensions – pose an immense danger to all the communities social workers engage with. The vote propelling Trump to the presidency illustrates how basic and flawed our democratic systems are. It demands a new urgency to strengthen community solidarity and expand the social work profession’s key role in supporting the systems of social protection that are required for people’s participation in democratic systems. The real winner in the election was clearly the culture of abstention among voters and their alienation from the systems that control their day-to-day lives and futures. While Hillary Clinton received a fractionally higher proportion of votes than Donald Trump, 42.2% of eligible voters did not engage in the electoral process. A further 7.8% of people were prevented from voting – meaning that in total 50% of people did not participate in the democratic process. This outcome represents a massive failure in people’s engagement in the political systems that dominate their lives. Social workers are acutely aware that voting every four years in the secrecy of a private booth, without further involvement in the political process, is the weakest form of democracy. It does not secure the kind of democracy and political structures needed to engage people’s involvement in the environments that dictate their health, security, rights and future wellbeing. Such limited democratic processes lack the interest and ability to foster interaction and engagement between people. This simple concept of democracy only asks people to say “yes” or “no” to a political future in which they are not engaged. Instead of interaction, people are subjected to manipulative political arguments that blame other races or nations for their disadvantage and discomfort. The consequence is disengagement, disillusion and alienation from the structures that people need to be involved with. Such alienation is compounded by inequality between the establishment and people seeking justice because of flawed social policies. The underlying motive of politics is to protect the status quo rather than working together to find solutions to problems. Social workers have consistently advocated the active involvement of people and communities in shaping our environment. This is a part of the profession’s belief that oppression and difficulties must be addressed at their root cause and not just at the level of symptoms. The role of social workers is enabling solidarity in families and between groups to develop inclusive systems and structures that respect the dignity of all people. It is therefore natural for us to advocate the development of active and engaging democratic structures, which support people’s participation in decision-making. The International Federation of Social Workers promotes the development in all countries of legislation that recognises the importance of community involvement in building real democratic structures. From a social work perspective, social services and welfare systems should be key platforms in building community cohesion and solidarity. Focusing on prevention rather than symptom relief, social services should bring communities together to actively participate and shape societies for the benefit of everyone. The social work contribution is to use our skills to bring people together into self-reliant, confident families and communities. That a minority of US citizens voted for Trump reflects that this is not a healthy democracy, but nor is this an isolated situation. Brexit, the growth of polarised political parties, the intensification of racism, blaming refugees, discrimination based on sexual orientation and identity are all consequences of political actions based on fear – not on the real engagement with people based on listening, understanding and working together for better solutions. The challenges generated by such limited versions of democracy have implications for the social work profession. In response, we continue to reinforce our focus on fostering community support systems. We champion the building of solidarity between people and efforts to support the voices of communities. We work with governments, presenting evidence on the benefits of building social capital to achieve economic and social sustainability. We join the demonstrations and movements linking people together in the call for real democracy and the recognition of all people’s rights.

52,2017-01-20T04:09:03Z,News,Australia’s conservative government fiddles on climate policy while the country burns,"When Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott as prime minister, serious action on global warming was hoped for – but almost nothing has changed","Australia’s January news has been full of official reports of record-breaking extreme weather devastating our ecosystems on land and in the sea and government ministers suggesting we build new coal-fired power stations, provide billion-dollar subsidised loans to rail lines for new coal mega-mines, increase coal exports to reduce temperature rises and reduce our ambitions for renewable power. The disconnect is glaring but perhaps dimmed in the eyes of some readers because Australian politicians have been dissembling on climate change for decades, pretending it will be possible to do what we must without any impact on our position as the world’s largest coal exporter or our domestic reliance on brown coal-fired power, or without incurring any costs. The Coalition government – which boasts as one of its proudest achievements the repeal of the former government’s emissions trading scheme – has a particular need for doublespeak. Having run two election campaigns on the pledge of “axing the tax” with hyperbolic assertions that it would strangle the economy and impoverish households, it found it convenient to claim the discovery of the climate policy equivalent of a free lunch. The Coalition has never resolved the bitter internal divisions with conservative climate doubters that saw Malcolm Turnbull overthrown as leader in 2009 owing to his support for carbon pricing, to be replaced by Tony Abbott, who had declared the settled science of climate change to be “crap” and believed coal was “good for humanity”. In September 2015 Turnbull overthrew Abbott but, since then, climate change has barely rated a mention and the new prime minister has surprised many by apparently falling into line with the mineral industry’s argument that our coal exports are really doing the world a big favour. Trump’s victory has emboldened the doubters – the resources minister, Matt Canavan, for example, enthused that “Donald Trump is good for fossil fuels, good for steel and good for Australia”. But it has also coincided with more conflicting responses from the government. Less than a day after the US election, the Turnbull government ratified the Paris agreement – the same agreement the new US president has vowed to “tear up” and that calls for zero net emissions by the second half of the century – describing it was a “watershed … that has galvanised global action”. But then it promptly abandoned a domestic policy idea that represented its last credible chance of meeting its promised targets or galvanising any real action here. With the world recording its third year in a row of record temperatures and the Great Barrier Reef bleaching, any objective assessment would suggest the time for prevarication and obfuscation is long since past. We’ll soon see. On 1 February, in his first major speech for the year, Turnbull will stand before the National Press Club to explain his policy on energy and the greenhouse gases it produces. Experts from business, industry and the environment movement are wondering what he can possibly say. For years the former environment minister had privately reassured stakeholders that a 2017 review would quietly morph the Direct Action policy into a so-called emissions intensity trading scheme and business and environment groups alike were clinging to those promises as the last hope for a credible climate policy and an end to the investment drought caused by years of mindless “climate wars” and policy uncertainty. But late last year, despite advice that such a scheme would lead to lower household power prices, despite having bipartisan support and just hours after the current environment minister said the review would look at it, the government ruled it out. Turnbull will announce new vehicle emissions standards and a new energy efficiency scheme. He and his office are looking at “technological solutions” – bright new ideas in solar thermal, or battery or carbon storage technology that might fill the policy void. But all those technologies need government policies to provide investors with incentives and certainty, and without actually confronting the climate doubters no one can imagine what that policy might be. Turnbull will also reassure voters, who repeatedly tell pollsters they are worried about global warming, that Australia will “meet and beat” its international targets, as it has in the past. But again complexity hides the underwhelming truth. Australia got not one but two special deals in the original Kyoto protocol – an allowance to increase its emissions in absolute terms – unlike almost all other developed countries, on account of our reliance on fossil fuels – and another special deal so particular to our circumstances it was called “the Australia clause”. It allowed the inclusion of land-use changes in emission calculations in a way that meant restrictions that had already been imposed on large-scale land clearing – especially in Queensland – allowed Australia to rest assured it had achieved its new target before it even signed up to it. The deal was so good we did “meet and beat” the target and, unlike almost all other developed countries, we are using that overshoot to help us also meet our very low 2020 target. But now state governments are overturning land-clearing restrictions and the federal government is arguing that states should abandon their regional renewable energy targets, which were only ever necessary because the federal scheme is effectively winding down. In short, we have done very little and we have no effective federal policies to shift to a low emissions economy, and everyone knows it. Trump gives the Australian sceptics the chance to run the same old arguments – if the US does nothing, then why should we? His victory has increased the prospect that some of them could split to form a new conservative party. The energy market remains so complex that all kinds of wild claims can be made to justify a do-nothing end. And international climate negotiations remain so byzantine that countries can claim hero status while doing very little. But the reality of global warming cannot be disguised by political obfuscation and the Turnbull government has run out of excuses. It has to have an honest internal reckoning – is it serious about climate policy or does it run with the sceptics? Trump’s election makes it more urgent that we finally have an honest debate."

Osborne’s fees from US appearances during the autumn topped £600,000, including £85,396.24 from Citibank for two speeches, £34,109.14 from BlackRock and £68,125.35 from Centerbridge Partners, a private investment firm. Osborne will work as an adviser at BlackRock’s investment institute which provides research for the investment managers. The New York-based firm oversees $5.1tn (£4.2tn) of investments for pensioners and savers. It is one of the biggest investors in companies on the stock market and is usually among the top three shareholders in FTSE 100 companies. Osborne will take on his advisory role at the firm where his former chief of staff, Rupert Harrison, is a strategist, and will work several days a month. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s founder and chief executive, said Osborne had “a unique and invaluable perspective on the issues that are shaping our world today”. “At the centre of our mission is helping people around the world save and invest for retirement, and George’s insights will help our clients achieve their goals,” said Fink, who was paid $26m last year. Both men have been attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, where Osborne has also been speaking at a number of events, including one for Britain’s biggest bank, HSBC. “BlackRock wants better outcomes for pensioners and savers, and I want to help them deliver that,” Osborne said. “It’s a chance for me to work part-time with one of the world’s most respected firms and a major employer in Britain.” John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, suggested the announcement’s proximity to Trump’s inauguration was “interesting timing”. However, a source close to Osborne said the timing was determined by an announcement by the advisory committee on business appointments, the government body that considers job moves for former ministers and senior civil servants. McDonnell said: “It looks like the former chancellor also seems to think that after Theresa May’s speech this week it’s looking like a bankers’ Brexit is what the Tories have in mind for our country. “But in the communities that have been hit hardest by his austerity policies of the last six years, people will wonder, are we all still in it together?” Osborne starts his job at the institute, which is run by Philipp Hildebrand, the former Swiss central bank governor and now BlackRock’s vice-chairman, on 1 February. He will provide “perspectives on European politics and policy, Chinese economic reform, and trends such as low yields and longevity and their impact on retirement planning”. He will not be involved in lobbying the UK government, BlackRock said. The announcement of his appointment came during a week in which the usually publicity-shy fund management firm spoke out about the level of executive pay by writing to the 350 biggest companies on the stock market to demand cuts to director pension entitlements and clear explanations for big pay rises for company bosses. The appointment also comes after Osborne’s fellow Conservative William Hague, who did not stand as an MP at the last election, took on a role at the US bank Citigroup and another Osborne former chief of staff, Thea Rogers, took on a “policy and communications” job at the takeaway app company Deliveroo."
54,2017-01-20T12:44:10Z,Opinion,Gove’s ‘snowflake’ tweet is symptomatic of the nastiness that’s ruining politics,"Twitter storms, online spats and insults are making it impossible to talk to one another and reach the compromises on which public life depends","There’s a new consensus about what social media is doing to public life: it’s making us meaner to each other. From behind a screen, we have the licence to be nasty to strangers, insult celebrities and swear at politicians. It’s fuelling misunderstanding and catalysing the spread of fake news. And because of self-reinforcing algorithms and the logic of friendship networks, we’re all cocooned with like-minded people and news we already agree with. Cyber-psychologists have known all this for ages. In 1990, the American lawyer and author Mike Godwin proposed a natural law of the behaviour of Usenet newsgroup conversations: “As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.” In short, the more you talk online, the more likely you’ll be nasty; talk long enough, and it’s a certainty. (Godwin’s law can easily be observed today on newspapers’ online comment threads.) A little later, the American academic John Suler was studying the behaviour of participants in early online chat rooms. He found that participants tended to be more aggressive and angry online than off. This was, he said, because when we’re protected by a screen, the usual social restrictions, responsibilities and norms don’t apply. We don’t know or see the people we’re speaking to, and they don’t know or see us. And because it all takes place in what feels like an alternate reality, we do things we wouldn’t in real life. Suler called this the “online disinhibition effect”. Back then, no one really listened to any of this because most of us weren’t online. But that’s all changed. People knowingly talk about “filter bubbles” and “echo chambers” over the dinner table. Liberals complain that Trump supporters are stuck in a fake news filter bubble, while Conservatives mock the liberals stuck in their elite echo chamber. This understanding is all at least partly true, but it involves always pinning the blame on someone else. However, communication is a two-way street. True, social media makes us more impulsive, less physically connected to the people we insult, and more likely to be rude. But it also affords the chance to get offended; 15 minutes on Facebook and you can rile yourself up nicely. If you want it, social media offers endless excuses to be outraged and angry. And why not? Being offended and outraged by someone else’s 140 characters is a perfectly pleasant sensation. I suspect a lot of people are quietly happy when they read something online they dislike. It provides a warm feeling of righteous indignation, and the chance to attack your enemies for being so damn ignorant and narrow-minded. In so doing you can express your own, morally superior, view. Said outrage can be put to political use. Which leads me to Conservative MP Michael Gove. It is in fact of little relevance whether Boris Johnson did or did not compare François Hollande to a Nazi guard earlier this week. You can’t blame “online disinhibition” for it: Johnson said this offline, at a speech in India. Back in 2002 he described black people as “piccaninnies” in a column; in 2006 Papua New Guineans were cannibals and chief killers. Johnson is unique in that he appears to have online disinhibition even when he is not online. What is relevant, though, is what followed this week: waves of pointless and escalating outrage. Some people online were upset by Johnson’s remark. They thought it was crass. Jackpot! Gove was upset that some people online were upset. He tweeted: “People ‘offended’ by the foreign secretary’s comments today are humourless, deliberately obtuse, snowflakes – it’s a witty metaphor #getalife”. Snowflake has become the shorthand rightwing – or libertarian – derogatory term for leftwing people who are easily offended. It’s a very easy way to dismiss opponents’ concerns. People who thought the foreign secretary might consider watching his words during delicate EU negotiations are thin-skinned idiots. Unlike Gove, who is a muscular liberal, an arch defender of free speech. But the snowflakes hit back. Gove was being intentionally and unnecessarily divisive. They were upset that Gove was upset that some people were upset. And on and on down the chain went the upset. Like the Capulets and Montagues, the original point of disagreement was swiftly forgotten. The feud fed itself, and both sides walked away feeling slightly more angry than when they started. This is why social media is making the business of politics nastier. Almost every politician is online. They are subject to the same feelings of mild outrage and anger as we all are. In a world of social media spats and Twitter storms, your opponents can’t simply hold a principled, different opinion. They must be bad. They must be incoherent babblers, sinister Machiavellians, politically correct elites, or hoodwinked buffoons. And they’re everywhere, these people! This makes compromise more difficult, since compromise depends on accepting that the people you disagree with hold their principled opinions in good faith. And without compromise, there is no politics. But it’s not “them” – those idiots on Twitter and Facebook – who are the problem. It’s also “us”, who secretly enjoy finding them, and sharing our outrage and moral rectitude with the world."
55,2017-01-20T04:00:22Z,News,"Monet, Renoir and a £44.2m Munch … billionaire opens Potsdam art gallery","Software firm founder Hasso Plattner launches his Barberini Museum, west of Berlin, with Impressionism show","A German software billionaire is opening a new art museum in the former imperial city of Potsdam on Friday, having reconstructed an 18th-century palace, destroyed in the second world war, to house the works. Hasso Plattner, a co-founder of the multinational software company SAP, described the Barberini Museum as his gift to the city and “one of the most important things” he had done in his life. The privately funded gallery occupies three floors of the building, which is in the heart of Potsdam, south-west of Berlin. Among the star exhibits will be Edvard Munch’s Girls on the Bridge, a depiction of transition to adulthood, which was sold at Sotheby’s auction house in New York last November for $54.5m (£44.2m), and is widely believed to have been bought by Plattner. The electrical engineer has refused to either confirm or deny the reports, but proudly pointed out the painting in the gallery during a preview this week. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, will be among the list of prominent guests at the museum’s grand opening, where John Fogerty, the former frontman and guitarist of the rock band Creedance Clearwater Revival will hold a concert. The debut exhibition, Impressionism: The Art of Landscape and Modern Art Classics, includes key works by Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, Wassily Kandinsky, Max Liebermann and Edvard Munch, many of which come from Plattner’s own collection which he has amassed over 20 years, and a large number which are on loan from international museums. The museum also includes a “smart wall” where visitors can forensically examine most of the collection’s paintings, which have been reproduced in images of 200m pixels. The Barberini’s inauguration marks the end of years of strife. Disputes over everything from what Plattner was allowed to exhibit to where the museum should be built have long made headline news. The project nearly foundered on several occasions. At one point Plattner threatened to retract his offer to give Potsdam its first new art gallery for 250 years, due to fears over new controversial heritage protection legislation. Under the Kulturgutschutzgesetz or national protection of cultural property law, Plattner risked having works from his own private art collection – which will be displayed in rotating exhibitions – confiscated by the German state if he tried to take them out of the country back to his home in Palo Alto, California, or sold them outside Germany. He has now reached an agreement with the cultural ministry which partially lifts the restrictions, but the fragile pact is believed to be one of the reasons he is being cautious about stating which of the works belong to him. At another stage in the planning Plattner proposed building the gallery on the site of a 60-metre high East Germany-era hotel, which the city had planned to destroy. But the backlash locally was enormous, leading to threats towards Plattner and accusations claiming he was among the increasing numbers of rich elite buying up the city and willing the destruction of a building held in great affection by many Potsdamers, not least because it symbolised a lost past. The Barberini completes the historic rebuilding of Potsdam’s Alter Markt square, which also includes a reconstructed baroque building housing the parliament for the state of Brandenburg. Leading art figures have said they expect it to have a big impact on the German museum landscape. The costs of reconstructing the historic facade and creating a modern airy interior for the palace – originally built by Frederick the Great who modelled it on the Palazzo Barberini in Rome – are estimated to have been more than €60m. The funding was provided by Plattner’s foundation, which also finances Germany’s only IT systems engineering university, also in Potsdam. Plattner, a Berliner who celebrates his 73rd birthday on Friday, left IBM in 1972 to co-found SAP, which is now the world’s third largest software and programming company. He is a member of The Giving Pledge, a group of billionaire philanthropists who promise to give half their wealth to charity during their lifetime or in a will. Plattner said: “I always wanted to make a museum. Berlin is blessed with state and private museums, and now Potsdam can make its presence felt with the Barberini.” Referring to the battles he had faced over his project, he said: “I can only put it down to the character flaw of jealousy and envy in us Germans. People originally told me to shut up, we don’t need another museum. But I hope the doubters will soon see what it gives to the city by bringing art lovers here in their droves as well as putting the finishing touches to recreating the historic centre of Potsdam.” The museum’s director, Ortrud Westheider, who previously ran the private gallery Bucerius in Hamburg, said the Barberini underlined the importance of putting art “at the heart of life”, saying: “I look forward to being able to continually fill this space with new energy and to give visitors an intimate encounter with original works, as well as establishing a new centre for art history.” She added that she found it poignant that the gallery was opening on the very day “when art institutes in the US feel they have no choice than to go on strike”, referring to the Art Strike by curators and artists in protest at the inauguration of the next US president, Donald Trump. “I think there the mood is far less joyous,” she said."
56,2017-01-20T17:09:54Z,News,"El Chapo is not a Robin Hood but a 'cancerous tumour', US prosecutor says",Joaquín Guzmán faces life in US prison and seizure of $14bn drug profitsAlleged drug kingpin pleaded not guilty at New York court hearing,"Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán could face the rest of his life in a US prison and have $14bn of his drug-trafficking profits seized by American authorities, US prosecutors said on Friday, a day after the cartel kingpin was extradited from Mexico to stand trial in New York. During a brief hearing at the Brooklyn federal court, Guzmán pleaded not guilty to charges that he lead a vast and murderous criminal operation that distributed 200 tons of cocaine for sale on American streets. Wearing a dark blue prison smock and trousers, blue tennis shoes and a light brown T-shirt, Guzmán shuffled into court with his hands behind his back looking subdued. Speaking quietly through a translator, he told judge James Orenstein that he understood the charges against him and the rights he had as a defendant. “Si, señor,” he repeated, in reply to Orenstein’s questions. He declined to apply for bail. Unveiling a 17-count indictment against Guzmán at a press conference on Friday morning, Robert Capers, the US attorney for the eastern district of New York, said Guzmán would be forced to answer for a “life of crime, violence, death and destruction” as the head of the Sinaloa cartel. “Guzmán’s story is not one of a do-gooder, or a Robin Hood, or an escape artist,” said Capers, referring to Guzmán’s record of twice fleeing Mexican prisons. Instead, said Capers, “Guzmán’s rise was akin to that of a small cancerous tumour that metastasized into a full-blown scourge”. Capers said that in addition to decades of drug trafficking, Guzmán had maintained an army of hitmen to commit murders in defence of his network, amassed a military-style arsenal of weapons, and personally carried a gold-plated AK-47 rifle and diamond-encrusted handgun. Standing alongside 20 officials from agencies including the FBI, NYPD, the Department of Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Administration, Capers said his announcement was the culmination of more than a decade of investigative work by multiple American authorities. Guzmán was flown into the US on a Mexican law enforcement plane late on Thursday. Officials said that after landing at MacArthur airport on Long Island, he was driven in a 13-vehicle motorcade to the metropolitan correction center in Manhattan, before being moved to Brooklyn at 7am on Friday. Special agent Angel Melendez, of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that for Guzmán “the realisation began to kick in that he was about to face American justice” upon his transfer to the country, which several officials said had taken the US government by surprise on Thursday. “As he deplaned, the most notorious criminal of modern times, as you looked into his eyes you could see the surprise, you could see the shock, and to a certain extent you could see the fear,” said Melendez. Amid speculation that Guzmán’s extradition was a parting gift from Mexico to the Obama administration, or even an early peace offering to incoming US president Donald Trump, Capers declined to comment on whether the timing had political significance. Officials also would not comment on where Guzmán would be detained and on extra precautions being taken to guard the capo, who twice absconded from high-security prisons in Mexico – most recently through a sophisticated underground passageway which led from his cell bathroom. Melendez said to laughter that “no tunnel will be built leading to his bathroom”. “What occurred in other countries will not occur here,” said Capers. Following his second escape in 2015, Guzmán was recaptured in a seedy motel in the city of Los Mochis after federal agents trailed the actor Sean Penn to a clandestine meeting with the fugitive kingpin. A 56-page memo filed to court by US authorities on Friday said that prosecutors plan to use at trial “a large coterie of cooperating witnesses”, including dozens of people who claim to have had face-to-face dealings with Guzmán and US-based drug distributors who were supplied by the Sinaloa cartel. One witness is expected to testify about Guzmán’s use of assassins against his rivals, “including his use of a house specially outfitted for murdering victims”, the court filing said. “The house had plastic sheets over the walls to catch spouting blood and a drain in the floor to facilitate the draining of blood.” Other witnesses are said to be prepared to testify about “specific murders carried out under Guzmán’s orders” including the killing of the cocaine trafficker Julio Beltrán, as well as Guzmán’s payment of bribes to Mexican politicians and law enforcement officials. Physical evidence, such as ledgers from Colombian drug cartel bosses detailing agreements with Guzmán, would also be used against him, according to the memo, along with intercepted electronic surveillance of Guzmán and “numerous physical surveillances” in the US and other countries. Authorities requested that Guzmán be detained pending his trial due to the severity of the allegations against him, the threat he posed to the public, and the risk that he would flee the country. Guzmán faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted. Prosecutors said in the indictment that the US also intends to seek the forfeiture of at least $14bn in money and property from Guzmán. Capers confirmed that in order to extradite Guzmán, Mexico had required that there was no possibility he would face the death penalty. The Guardian disclosed last year that the US had quietly removed specific murder charges against Guzmán from his charge sheet. A grand jury indictment first filed in Brooklyn in September 2014, when the outgoing US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, was the district’s top federal prosecutor, had charged Guzmán and an ally with 12 murders that were carried out in Mexico between 2000 and 2008, along with two attempted murders and multiple murder conspiracies against rival cartels."
57,2017-01-20T16:19:50Z,Opinion,"They call it fun, but the digital giants are turning workers into robots","With perfect timing, a new film highlights how employee monitoring is taking over people’s lives","“Secrets are lies; sharing is caring; privacy is theft.” So run the three Orwellian aphorisms at the heart of Dave Eggers’ 2013 novel The Circle, whose film version – starring Emma Watson and Tom Hanks – will arrive in cinemas this spring. Given that the story centres on an omnipotent hybrid of Google, Twitter and Facebook, and asks exacting questions about their shared vision of the future, the timing is perfect – chiming with rising angst about the digital giants’ imperial approach to information, and the sense that their power and recklessness is now having so-called real-world impacts, and huge ones at that. Such, perhaps, is the zeitgeist of early 2017: tech-fear fusing with terror about Donald Trump and Brexit, leaving millions of us in a state of twitchy anxiety. At the heart of the novel and film is the Circle corporation, whose logo suggests a stylised panopticon, and whose leaders want to shape the world in the image of their Californian HQ. There, privacy and autonomy count for almost nothing. Under a veneer of feelgoodism, employees are complicit in their own constant monitoring and a system of endless appraisal by their peers, who feed into a system called Participation Rank – or PartiRank, for short. The details of their online and offline lives are judged according to “an algorithim-generated number” that measures their activity. “It’s just for fun,” a company high-up tells the story’s principal character. But, of course, it isn’t: that’s just one more example of the passive-aggressive ways of Silicon Valley, underpinned by the insane demands summed up in one of the Circle’s slogans, “Let’s do this. Let’s do all of this.” Even when it was published, The Circle – whose plot is driven by the drive to make the whole of humanity “clear”, or subject to constant online scrutiny – felt less like satire than a pretty accurate portrayal of where advanced societies were headed, particularly in relation to workplace surveillance, and the way it is blurring into the monitoring of the whole of people’s lives. Of course, from the punch-clock to the tyranny of time-and-motion studies, businesses have always tried to maximise control of their workers, usually under the auspices of efficiency. But the digital age has long since allowed this tendency to take mind-boggling forms. I spoke this week to a trade union organiser who works in two key fields: the huge warehouses run by online retail giants, and driver deliveries. In the former, she told me, employees are often tracked so closely that their managers can see if they pause between tasks or, even more unthinkably, stop for a chat with their fellow workers – something betrayed when dots on a GPS machine cluster together. Socialising becomes all but impossible; the idea of meeting a partner at work looks like a laughable relic. Meanwhile, when it comes to anything that involves a human being and a car, van or lorry, the same tracking means productivity must be squeezed out of every second: even stopping at Tesco for a sandwich can be an unwise decision. Fighting all this, I was told, is usually viable only in workplaces with a strong union – and besides, people used to their work being constantly monitored tend to now expect it: as my contact put it, “They don’t think it’s that bad. It seems normal.”These long-standing techniques are now creeping into supposedly higher-ranking jobs. PartiRank may be fictional, but there are no end of real-life equivalents: “platforms” companies can buy in that allow them not just to track their employees’ movements and interactions but to install exactly the kind of continuing, neurotic-looking peer appraisal Eggers wrote about. If you hear the term “people analytics”, worry. Some systems are straightforwardly intrusive: Worksnaps, for example, is an application that can take repeated screenshots of workers’ computers, count their mouse-clicks and take webcam images. Others are more passive-aggressive: BetterWorks uses a Facebook-like application that depends on employees publicly posting their supposed workplace goals, and regularly issuing “cheers” and “nudges” to their colleagues. “In the office of the future,” says the chief executive of the company responsible, “you will always know what you are doing and how fast you are doing it.” The increasing ubiquity of Fitbits – the wearable devices that track how much you walk, the quality of your sleep, your heart rate and more – is of a piece. The US retail chain Target announced in 2015 that Fitbit trackers were to be offered to its 335,000 workers, as part of its embrace of what the business vernacular calls “corporate wellness programmes”. As things stand, workers who opt to have their metabolisms monitored are organised into teams who compete to raise money for charity. Just for fun, then. Until, perhaps, it’s not. If you doubt the sinister elements of what’s going on, consider the case of Myrna Arias, who worked for a Miami-based money exchange company that insisted she download a tracking app on to her phone that logged her whereabouts 24 hours a day. She deleted the app and was fired, leading to legal action that was settled out of court. Or maybe have a look at the story of two parking inspectors in Sydney recently sacked for the content of conversations picked up on their body cameras. Closer to home, according to reports last weekend, a US-based company called Humanyze – nice, that – is working with British businesses including a high street bank and the consulting firm Deloitte, as well as parts of the NHS. On first sight, it is hard to shake off the feeling that what they do must be some sort of joke: their methods are all about “sociometric” badges worn by employees to record their movements, interactions and “speaking patterns”. To quote one account of what that entails: “Humanyze’s badge can track physical activities in real time, capture ‘nonlinguistic social signals such as interest and excitement’ without recording actual words, locate wearers and their proximity to other wearers, and communicate with other electronic devices.” The company says that its work helps companies “enhance teamwork and employee engagement, improve processes, and plan for growth”. What it does to the people who have to wear the badges is so far unclear. In the context of the automated future, what all this means is pretty obvious. On the way to being replaced by a robot, you will have to become one, and tumble into a mode of existence glimpsed 20 years ago on the amazingly prescient Radiohead album OK Computer, in the sound-collage titled Fitter Happier. Intoned by a Stephen Hawking-like speech synthesizer, the words long ago became a grimly funny signifier for modern living: “Fitter, happier / More productive / Comfortable / Not drinking too much / Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week / Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries.” And here we are – with, unbelievably, the selfsame vision now enforced by wraparound surveillance. Judging by the way the idea is sold, the people responsible, for reasons that speak volumes about the tech world’s endless naivety, they see it as a kind of super-efficient utopia. Anyone with a grasp of what makes us human should surely recognise it for what it is: Stasi capitalism, apparently furthering its dominance at a terrifying speed, with only the faintest murmurs of protest."
58,2017-01-20T12:00:06Z,News,Totes annoying: words that should be banned,The internet is the source of many crimes against language – and these are among the worst offenders,"We all have a watershed word – the word that tells us it’s all over, that the internet has won, and our youth is gone for ever. For me, it was Yolo, or You Only Live Once. It was born, I used it, and rooms fell eerily silent as soon as it left my mouth. Yolo belonged to the others, the younger people; it carbon-dated me and I was envious. You might call it snobbery but, for me, every delicious new bit of slang reminds me I’m being left behind, along with VHS cassettes, legwarmers and Lady Gaga. Susie Dent, Countdown’s resident lexicographer, tells me I should lighten up. “Slang has always moved this way,” she says. “From Cockney rhyming slang to codes swapped among highwaymen, they’re tribal badges of identity, bonding mechanisms designed to distinguish the initiated, and to keep strangers out.” The linguist and author David Crystal agrees: “Remember the old maxim – the chief use of slang is to show you’re one of the gang.” Fine: I’m not one of the gang. But surely even the experts would admit there are some words that urgently need to be retired, or at least restricted to people under 25? “If a term becomes too popular, its irritant value is ramped up,” Dent agrees. “The impulse is then to replace it with something else.” This, then, is my highly subjective glossary of words that should be binned in 2017 – the most annoying, the most misused, the most broken. Is one of these your “Yolo”? It’s a hotly contested field. Because internet “A lot of purists hate this one, but I think it’s quite inventive and useful as a shortcut,” Susie Dent says. The main issue here is a fake sense of guilt. We’re allowed to enjoy cat gifs, videos of people falling over and animations of a horse playing with a chicken without blaming it on the internet. That’s what the internet is for! You’re not above watching a 10-minute supercut of every time Alexis Carrington from Dynasty walked into a room and said “Krystle!” and you shouldn’t pretend otherwise. Because internet? Because you. Totes Here lies the body, but not the soul, of “totally”, bastardised beyond recognition from a gorgeous, absolute adverb into an uber-chilled shrug or nod of the head. Not only that, it has a tendency to take other words down with it. “Totes emosh”, “totes cray”: no syllable is safe. All is not lost, however: so omnipresent is “totes” that your grandmother says it to mean “yes”, which means it should be getting measured up for its wooden overcoat pretty soon. That thing when A shortcut to starring in your very own scene from Seinfeld, “That thing when” attempts to glitter the very dullest of all the concrete: our everyday lives. “That thing when your five-year-old sees Donald Trump on the TV and says he looks like a walnut whip.” “That thing when a girl hits on you in the gym, but you’re married to the weights and gotta say no.” It’s easy to see why it’s popular – “that thing when you sit staring into your phone for hours at a time praying for something, anything, to happen until finally you just make something up” doesn’t quite cut it. Amaze, or awesomesauce Awesomesauce may sound like a ketchup business started by the dullest, most bored and married of your friends, but it’s actually a cutesy way of saying something is great, that you like it. It’s an uncomfortably long hug from an overfamiliar stranger, or a double thumbs up from your manager on a team-building day, at the exact moment you decide you never want to join in. “Amaze” is the same, but has wider, more enthusiastic eyes, which it rolls very hard at you when you’re not looking. Sorry not sorry This is the battlecry of the wilfully unapologetic, who see themselves as edgy mavericks while they go about their daily business dropping truth bombs (being rude), taking no prisoners (being rude again) and making baristas’, waiters’ and shop assistants’ lives a misery because they’re too important to be polite. School night If you wear an itchy uniform, have chemistry in the morning and your alarm clock is a parent, then fine. If you’re kidulting through your 30s and don’t want to stay out for another drink, just say you’re tired: everybody else is, too. But also: live a little, go to work hungover. Again, everybody else is. Man crush This is alpha masculinity’s rare nod to homosexuality, which might come after watching a Ryan Gosling film, realising how cool he is and kind of wanting to be him and marry him all at the same time. Still, it’s better than “no homo”, I guess. Methinks Words you love are dying all over the place, yet this centuries-old signaller of faux-intelligence and an incoming garbage opinion prevails. Used by people who want to come across as clever, authoritative or interesting, but actually sound argumentative and pretentious. And old. “I’ve used this one for years,” Dent admits. Awkward. The Boy This sobriquet for the man of your dreams would be charming if he were the lead in a romantic novel. It tends to lose its lustre quite quickly when it becomes clear he’s a crashing, bumbling bore who can’t tuck his shirt into his pants, misses the bowl when he uses the loo, and forgets your birthday every other year. The trouble with The Boy is that he’s mythical. In reality, he’s all grown up; he’s just A Man. Banter The moth-eaten cape of respectability afforded to demeaning words, teasing, bullying or harassment. Banter is a secret handshake that permits you to say just about anything you want and nobody can get offended. Anyone who doesn’t fall into line is just being a buzzkill, mate – they’re not even worthy of your bantz. If banter had a face, you would never tire of punching it. Food baby Pain is pleasure’s natural pudding, and your eager forays into “nom nom” and #foodporn territory can result in only one thing: a food baby. Parents-to-be proudly pat their distended midriff like nobody ever ate before, but unless that burger is going to somehow pop out of you and demand both your attention and the entire contents of your bank account for the next 18 years (more like 40, who are we kidding?), then it’s not a baby, baby. I can’t even Pity the poor “I can’t even” crew – continually presented with situations that render them dumbstruck, able only to react with hands clamped to their face and a wide-eyed stare. Nothing trumps “I can’t even”; not “outraged”, “disgusted” or “horrified”. Once you can’t even, you can’t anything – you’re unmatchable. Sleeps “Just two more sleeps until my birthday,” Timmy says as you tuck the covers in tight. There’d be no problem were Timmy a freckly youngster in cartoon pyjamas. Timmy, however, is a middle manager in his 30s and, predictably, his birthday is set to last a whole week, because these things always do. But this isn’t just infantilisation, according to David Crystal, it’s a very old English usage, proving that basicness is one genetic trait we can’t breed out. Parentals The disturbingly cold trend for describing your mum and dad as a pair of androids isn’t actually as space age as you might think; this usage was recorded by the OED in the 16th century. “Mothership”, however, when talking about your dear old mum, is newer, but still unacceptable. If she knew you’d said that, she’d be bundling you into an escape pod and shooting you right out into space. All the feels Anger, joy, love, pain, misery, shock, excitement: they’re all present and correct, but in between the nerve endings and the mouth, or the typing fingers, they become a rush of something conveniently indefinable. “The feels” is almost an embarrassment, as if you can’t believe something is making you emotional, so you explain it away as “the feels” and hope it will pass. The feels can strike at any time: looking at a baby polar bear, mourning a dead relative or reading about Aleppo – as long as you’ve got your feels handy, there’s no need to, well, say how you actually feel. On the internet, the fact you’re feeling something is usually enough. #blessed “I want the good things in my life to look like a happy accident and I also have an overwhelming desire for you to envy me. If we were next-door neighbours, I’d own everything you do, only one price point up.” Hubby Most husbands have names – John, Dave, Benoît, even – but if someone really wants you to know they have one, that dude will be known only as “Hubby”. It’s used by those recently wed and bizarrely anxious to show they’re settled and sorted. First recorded in 1600, in 2017 “Hubby” is wrapped in “I have one, you don’t” smugness, a fast-forward to the kind of cosy resentment only 20 years of marriage can bring you. Listen carefully, and you can almost hear Hubby’s slippers shuffling towards you – even though he’s only 29. Lit “Pretentious maybe, but quite poetic,” Susie Dent says, “and another move on for lit and its meaning of drunk or high.” Yep, it’s brilliantly expressive when used by cool teens describing the illegal rave they’re at, and definitely works when you’re talking about Beyoncé’s post-Grammys party packed with A-listers. But your dreary barbecue or gathering of thirtysomethings in a conservatory with a leaky roof? Lit it most certainly is not. Bring accelerant. Cheeky Struggling very hard to come out the other side of a huge identity crisis in recent years, is the adjective “cheeky”. It belongs to impudent young rapscallions in the playground, buttocks, Carry On movies. It should not be a conspiratorial wink while you enjoy a gin and tonic, a holiday, a trip to the shops, getting up to something illegal in a cubicle or eating some bloody chicken. Goals Envy masquerading as ambition can be quite the driver when it comes to careers, travel or even a “squad” – a bunch of celebrity mates you covet. But when your “goals” relate to a stranger’s bacon sandwich, it might be time to think bigger. Going to the supermarket is not “grocery goals”. Come on. • Justin Myers blogs as theguyliner.com"
